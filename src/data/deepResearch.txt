Comprehensive Guide to Federal and State Veteran Benefits

Federal Veteran Benefit Programs

Veterans, active-duty service members, and their families are eligible for a wide range of federal benefits. Below is an overview of key federal programs by category, including their purpose, eligibility, how to apply, and references to official resources.

Health Care (VA Medical Benefits & TRICARE)

VA Health Care: The VA provides comprehensive medical care to eligible veterans through VA hospitals and clinics nationwide. Veterans who served in the active military and received any discharge other than dishonorable generally qualify (with certain minimum service requirements for post-1980 enlistees) ￼. VA health benefits include preventative care, inpatient/outpatient services, mental health care, prescriptions, and specialty programs. Eligibility: Most veterans who completed their service obligation and did not receive a dishonorable discharge are eligible; combat veterans and those with service-connected disabilities have enhanced eligibility ￼ ￼. How to Enroll: Submit an application for health benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) online, by mail, or in person at a VA medical center. Enrollment can also be done via phone (1-877-222-VETS).

TRICARE (DoD Health Insurance): Active-duty service members (and their dependents) and military retirees (and dependents) receive health coverage through TRICARE, the Department of Defense’s health program. TRICARE offers various plans (Prime, Select, etc.) depending on beneficiary category and location. Eligibility: All active-duty members are automatically covered; family members and retirees must enroll in an appropriate TRICARE plan. How to Enroll: Through the TRICARE website or regional contractors; enrollment is typically done upon entry to active duty or during open season for changes. (Note: Veterans who are retired from military service can use TRICARE; other veterans generally use VA health care if eligible.)

CHAMPVA: The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the VA provides health insurance for eligible dependents (spouses, children) of veterans who are 100% permanently and totally disabled from service-connected conditions or who died from such conditions. Eligibility: Notably, family members cannot be eligible for TRICARE and CHAMPVA at the same time. How to Enroll: Apply through the VA’s CHAMPVA application (VA Form 10-10d) with documentation of the veteran’s status.

Disability Compensation (VA Service-Connected Disability Pay)

VA Disability Compensation: This is a tax-free monthly benefit paid to veterans for disabilities that are the result of diseases or injuries incurred or aggravated during active military service ￼. The amount is graduated according to the severity of the disability (rated 0%–100% in 10% increments). Eligibility: Any veteran with a service-connected condition (physical or mental) may be eligible, regardless of when the condition arose, as long as it is linked to service. Discharge must not be dishonorable. How to Apply: File a disability claim with the VA (online via VA.gov or by mail using VA Form 21-526EZ). The VA will review service medical records, possibly schedule exams, and issue a rating decision. Note: Veterans can receive additional compensation for severe disabilities (like loss of limb) or if they have dependents and a disability rating of 30% or higher. Compensation benefits are tax-free at the federal level ￼.

Concurrent Receipt: Military retirees with a VA disability rating may be eligible for concurrent receipt of both retirement pay and VA compensation (certain laws like CRDP/CRSC allow this for those with 50%+ ratings or combat-related disabilities, eliminating the offset that used to occur).

Veterans Pension (Needs-Based Benefit)

VA Pension: A separate benefit from disability compensation, the VA pension is a needs-based program for wartime veterans who have limited income and assets and are either age 65 or older or permanently and totally disabled from non-service-connected causes ￼. The pension provides a monthly cash benefit to bring the veteran’s income to a level set by Congress (Maximum Annual Pension Rate). Eligibility: Veterans must have served at least 90 days of active duty (with at least one day during a defined wartime period) and have a discharge other than dishonorable. They must meet income and net worth limits (the VA considers other sources of income, excluding SSI and welfare). Surviving spouses and unmarried minor children of wartime veterans may qualify for a similar Survivors Pension. How to Apply: File VA Form 21P-527EZ (for veterans) or VA Form 21P-534EZ (for survivors) online or with a VA regional office. Applicants will need to provide financial information for means testing.

Education Benefits (GI Bill and Others)

Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33): The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides financial support for education and housing to individuals with at least 90 days of aggregate active-duty service after September 10, 2001, or individuals discharged with a service-connected disability after 30 days. It covers tuition and fees (paid directly to public colleges up to full in-state tuition, or up to a cap for private schools), a monthly housing allowance, and an annual stipend for books and supplies ￼. Eligibility: Generally, honorably discharged veterans (or still-serving members) who meet the service requirements. The percentage of benefit ranges from 50% to 100% depending on length of service (100% for 36 months or more of service, or discharged due to service-connected disability after at least 30 days). Transfers: Active-duty members may transfer unused Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a spouse or children if they have at least 6 years of service and commit to 4 more years; the family member must enroll in DEERS. How to Use: Apply to the VA for a Certificate of Eligibility, then enroll in school and coordinate with the school’s certifying official. Yellow Ribbon Program: for costs beyond public tuition caps, certain schools and the VA will fund the overage for eligible veterans (100% GI Bill eligibility only).  ￼

Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB Chapters 30 & 1606): An older program – Chapter 30 for active duty veterans who paid $1,200 enrollment fee and Chapter 1606 for Selected Reserve members. Provides a monthly payment for education for up to 36 months. Eligibility: Generally requires an honorable discharge and a minimum service commitment (e.g., 2–3 years active duty for Chapter 30). Usage: The MGIB benefit is paid to the student to help defray education costs (unlike Post-9/11, which pays schools directly). Many veterans now opt for Post-9/11 if eligible, as it’s usually more generous. (Note: By law, one cannot use MGIB and Post-9/11 for the same period of service; however, some may exhaust MGIB then switch to Post-9/11 for additional time).

Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E, Chapter 31): VR&E (previously “Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment”) is a program to help service-disabled veterans (typically with a VA disability rating of at least 10% with a serious employment handicap, or 20% with an employment handicap) prepare for, find, and maintain suitable careers ￼. It can include education benefits (tuition, fees, books) similar to GI Bill, on-the-job training, apprenticeships, vocational counseling, and other services needed for employment. Eligibility: A veteran with a service-connected disability that impedes their ability to work. Generally must use within 12 years of separation or of being notified of a qualifying disability rating. How to Apply: Apply through VA’s VR&E (often via eBenefits or VA.gov). You’ll meet with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor to create a plan. If education is part of the plan, VR&E may pay tuition (and stipend) in lieu of GI Bill usage.  ￼ ￼

Dependents’ Education (Chapter 35 DEA & Fry Scholarship): The Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA) program (Chapter 35) provides education and training benefits to eligible dependents of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled due to service, or who died on active duty or as a result of a service-related condition. It offers up to 36 months of education benefits (payments made directly to the student). The Fry Scholarship provides Post-9/11 GI Bill–like benefits to the surviving children or spouses of service members who died in the line of duty after Sept 10, 2001. Eligibility: For DEA, the spouse or child of a 100% disabled veteran (or veteran who died of service-connected causes). For Fry, the child (under 33) or spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty post-9/11. How to Apply: Dependents apply via VA Form 22-5490. Fry Scholarship is applied similarly via the GI Bill application process.

Housing and Home Loans

VA Home Loan Guaranty: The VA home loan program helps veterans, active-duty, and some surviving spouses purchase or refinance homes with favorable terms (like no down payment and no private mortgage insurance required). VA does not directly lend money (except for certain Native American Direct Loans); instead, it guarantees a portion of loans made by private lenders to eligible individuals ￼. This guaranty encourages lenders to offer loans with better terms (often lower interest rates and easier qualification). Eligibility: Generally, veterans who served 90 days wartime or 181 days peacetime active duty (or 2 years if enlisted after 1980), and Guard/Reserve members with 6+ years of service, and who have an other-than-dishonorable discharge, are eligible. Active-duty members become eligible after about 90 days of continuous service. Unremarried surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected causes may also be eligible. How to Use: Obtain a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) through VA (online eBenefits or via lender). Then find a lender offering VA loans. Benefit details: No down payment required (in most cases) ￼, limits on closing costs, no PMI, and the ability to refinance with streamline Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans (IRRRL). There is a one-time funding fee (which can be financed into the loan) unless exempt (exemption usually for those receiving VA disability compensation) ￼.

Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grants: The VA offers housing grants for severely disabled veterans to adapt or purchase housing suitable for their disabilities. For example, veterans with certain severe service-connected disabilities (like loss of limb use, blindness, severe burns, ALS, etc.) may qualify for the SAH grant (up to an amount over $100k) to construct or modify a home. A smaller SHA (Special Housing Adaptation) grant is for other specific disabilities (around $20k). Eligibility: Must have a qualifying service-connected disability (e.g., loss of or loss of use of both legs, or blindness plus loss of limb use, etc. for SAH). How to Apply: Through VA (VA Form 26-4555).

Homeless Veterans Housing Programs: The VA, in partnership with HUD, runs programs like HUD-VASH which provides rental housing vouchers and VA case management for homeless veterans. There are also Grant and Per Diem (GPD) transitional housing programs and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) which provides financial assistance and services to prevent homelessness. Eligibility: These are targeted to veterans who are homeless or at risk. How to Get Help: Contact a VA medical center or call the VA’s homeless veteran helpline to connect to these programs.

State Veterans Homes: (Although state-operated, mention here for completeness) Many states run veteran nursing homes, often in partnership with VA (which can subsidize some costs). Severely disabled or elderly veterans may reside in these at low cost. Eligibility: Typically honorably discharged veterans (and sometimes spouses/Gold Star parents) who need nursing care. How to Apply: Through the specific state veterans home.

Employment and Training

Veterans’ Preference in Federal Hiring: By federal law, qualified veterans receive preference points when applying to federal jobs. A 5-point preference is awarded to honorably discharged veterans who served during defined wartime or campaign periods; a 10-point preference is for veterans with service-connected disabilities (or certain eligible spouses, widows, or mothers) ￼. This gives veterans a hiring edge for most federal jobs (except in certain merit-based promotions, etc.). Eligibility: Must meet criteria under Title 5 USC; e.g., served during a war or in a campaign, or have a service-connected disability. How to Use: Claim preference when applying via USAJOBS by providing DD-214 and any VA disability award letter if applicable.

Transition Assistance Program (TAP): TAP is a 5-day (often longer now) workshop and counseling program for service members separating or retiring from active duty. It covers resume writing, job search skills, translation of military skills, and VA benefits briefing ￼. Eligibility: Mandatory for most service members before separation (usually 180 days before ETS/retirement). How to Participate: Coordinate through your base’s Transition Office (usually run by DoD in partnership with DOL and VA).

Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E): (mentioned above under Education) VR&E is fundamentally an employment program for disabled veterans – providing vocational counseling, training, education, and job placement assistance to help veterans with service-connected disabilities find suitable careers ￼. Eligibility: Service-connected disability (generally rating ≥10% with an employment handicap). Apply: via VA VR&E division (see above).

Department of Labor Programs: The Department of Labor’s Veterans’ Employment and Training Service (VETS) provides resources like the Jobs for Veterans State Grants (JVSG) program which funds specialists in state workforce agencies (Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program specialists and Local Veterans’ Employment Representatives) who provide intensive employment assistance to veterans. The Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program (HVRP) provides job training to homeless vets. Eligibility: Varies by program (e.g., HVRP requires veteran status and homelessness). Access: Typically through local state employment offices or American Job Centers, which have veteran staff to assist (often labeled as “Vet reps”).

Skills Training and Entrepreneurship: Veterans may use their education benefits for vocational training, apprenticeships, or on-the-job training programs (where the VA pays a monthly benefit while the veteran learns a trade). There are also programs like SkillBridge (DoD program allowing transitioning service members to intern with civilian companies in last 180 days of service) and Veteran Entrepreneur support (the Small Business Administration has Veteran Business Outreach Centers, and VA’s Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization offers guidance). Eligibility: For SkillBridge, active-duty within 180 days of separation and command approval ￼. For SBA programs, honorably discharged veterans (and spouses). How to Access: SkillBridge via base education/transition office. SBA veteran programs via local SBA offices or SBA.gov.

Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA): This federal law protects the job rights of individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave civilian employment to perform military service. It ensures that members of the Reserve and National Guard can return to their civilian jobs after serving and not be penalized in their career for time spent in service ￼. Eligibility: Applies to those who leave a non-temporary civilian job for service (up to 5 years, with some exceptions for longer). How it works: The service member must give prior notice to employer, and upon return, timely application for reemployment. USERRA also protects against discrimination based on military service and mandates that returning service members be reemployed in the job they would have attained had they not been away (or a comparable job) with same seniority, status, pay.

Life Insurance Benefits

Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI): Active-duty members, Guard/Reserve members, and certain cadets are automatically insured under SGLI, a low-cost group term life insurance, unless they opt out. Coverage is up to $500,000 (as of recent updates) and can be elected in $50,000 increments. Eligibility: Generally, all service members on active duty or active reserve are covered. Enrollment: Automatic, but members can decline or reduce coverage via SGLV 8286 form. Premiums are deducted from pay. SGLI also includes Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI), which provides a one-time payment ($25,000 to $100,000) for certain severe injuries (e.g., limb loss, blindness, etc.) ￼.

Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI): Upon separation, SGLI can be converted to Veterans’ Group Life Insurance, a renewable term life policy that the veteran can keep for life as long as premiums are paid ￼. VGLI allows up to the amount of coverage the member had under SGLI. Eligibility: Available to those who had SGLI and are within 1 year and 120 days of leaving service or the Guard/Reserve ￼. No health questions if converted within that period (if applied within 240 days of separation, no medical underwriting required). How to Enroll: Apply online through the VA or Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) within the eligible window after separation ￼.

Family SGLI (FSGLI): Provides life insurance coverage for spouses and dependent children of service members with SGLI. Spouses are insured up to $100,000 (not to exceed the member’s coverage) and children are automatically covered for $10,000 at no cost. Eligibility: Spouses and children of members with full-time SGLI. Enrollment: Automatic for spouses (with premium) and children (free) when data is updated in DEERS, but members can decline coverage for spouse.

Service-Disabled Veterans Life Insurance (S-DVI) / VA Life Insurance (VALife): For many years, S-DVI provided up to $10,000 coverage for veterans who have service-connected disabilities and are in good health otherwise (application within 2 years of VA rating). Recently, VA introduced VALife (Veterans Affairs Life Insurance) as a new program (effective Jan 2023) offering up to $40,000 whole-life coverage for veterans with any level of service-connected disability, with no medical exam and no time limit to apply (premiums based on age). Eligibility: Veterans with service-connected disabilities (for VALife, even 0% rating qualifies). S-DVI closed to new applicants after 2022, replaced by VALife. How to Apply: VALife applications are through VA.gov (the program is administered by VA).

Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI): Mortgage protection insurance up to $200,000 for severely disabled veterans (those who received a SAH grant for specially adapted housing). It pays off the home mortgage in the event of the veteran’s death. Eligibility: Must be a recipient of an SAH/SHA grant and have title to the home. Enrollment: Apply through the Specially Adapted Housing program; coverage is generally automatic offer when SAH is approved, but veteran must accept and pay premiums.

Survivor and Dependent Benefits

Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC): DIC is a tax-free monthly benefit paid to surviving spouses, children, or parents of service members who died in the line of duty, or veterans who died from service-related injuries or diseases. Surviving spouses generally qualify if the veteran’s death was service-connected (or if the veteran was rated 100% service-connected disabled for a certain period before death, e.g., 10 years) ￼. The base DIC rate for a surviving spouse is set by Congress (with added amounts for children or if the survivor is disabled, etc.). Eligibility: Surviving spouse (who married the veteran before certain deadlines or for at least one year), unmarried children under 18 (or 23 if in school), or adult children with disabilities. Parents DIC is income-based for surviving parents. How to Apply: File VA Form 21-534 (for spouses/dependents) with supporting documentation (marriage certificate, death certificate, etc.).

Survivors Pension (Death Pension): As noted earlier, for low-income surviving spouses or unmarried minor children of wartime veterans, the VA offers a needs-based pension. This is different from DIC in that it’s not tied to cause of death (the veteran’s death can be non-service-related) but is income-limited. Eligibility: The veteran must have met wartime service requirements and had an other-than-dishonorable discharge. The survivor’s income and net worth must be below the threshold. Application: VA Form 21P-534 (same as for DIC; VA will determine which benefit is applicable).

Dependents’ Education (DEA) & Scholarships: (Covered under education section above for Chapter 35 and Fry Scholarship). In addition, some dependents may be eligible for tutoring assistance or work-study if they use DEA benefits. There are also federal scholarship programs like the Marine Gunnery Sgt. John David Fry Scholarship (Post-9/11 GI Bill for survivors, discussed above) and other specialized scholarships (e.g., for children of fallen service members through the Dept. of Defense or state programs).

Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) – Department of Defense: This is a DoD annuity program (not VA) but an important benefit for retiring service members. Retiring military can elect SBP coverage, which will pay their spouse (or other designated beneficiary) a monthly percentage of their retirement pay for life if the retiree dies. There is a cost (premium) taken from retirement pay. Eligibility: Any retiring service member can enroll; automatic free coverage also exists for line-of-duty deaths of active members (since 2001, DoD pays a death gratuity and the survivor can get an annuity similar to SBP called the Active Duty Survivor Benefit). Enrollment: Retirees elect at retirement (Default is automatic coverage for spouses at max level unless waived with spouse consent). Note: SBP is distinct from VA benefits; survivors can receive both SBP and DIC (as of 2023, the offset between SBP and DIC was fully eliminated).

Burial and Memorial Benefits

Burial in National Cemeteries: Eligible veterans, service members who die on active duty, and certain family members (spouses, dependent children) can be buried in a VA national cemetery (or state veterans cemetery, many of which follow similar rules) at no cost for the gravesite, grave opening/closing, perpetual care, a government headstone or marker, and a burial flag ￼ ￼. Eligibility: Generally, any veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable is eligible for burial in a national cemetery. Spouses and minor children are also eligible, even if the veteran is not buried at that cemetery (through a family member reservation). How to Use: At time of need, next-of-kin or funeral provider can request burial through the National Cemetery Scheduling Office. It’s recommended that veterans have their discharge (DD-214) accessible to expedite eligibility verification.

Headstones, Markers, and Medallions: VA will provide a free headstone or grave marker for eligible veterans buried in any cemetery (national, state, or private) worldwide, or a medallion to affix to an existing private headstone, upon request. Eligibility: Most veterans with other-than-dishonorable discharge. How to Apply: VA Form 40-1330 submitted by next-of-kin or cemetery official.

Burial Allowance (Funeral and Interment Benefits): The VA offers a partial reimbursement of burial and funeral costs for eligible veterans. If a veteran’s death is service-connected, a higher amount is paid (around $2,000) ￼. If non-service-connected but the veteran was receiving VA compensation/pension or died in a VA facility, smaller allowances are paid for funeral expenses and burial plot (~$300–$800 ranges, indexed annually). Eligibility: The veteran must be discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and meet the criteria above (service-connected death or under VA care/compensation). How to Apply: VA Form 21P-530 (Application for Burial Benefits), along with receipts/proof of death, to the VA.

Presidential Memorial Certificates: The VA provides an engraved certificate, signed by the President, to honor the memory of honorably discharged deceased veterans. Eligibility: Honorably discharged veterans. Request: Through VA’s PMC program (application via mail or via funeral home usually).

Military Funeral Honors: By law, all eligible veterans can receive military funeral honors if requested, typically provided by a DoD honor guard (folding and presenting the flag, and playing Taps). Eligibility: Generally any veteran who served honorably (dishonorable discharge is excluded). How to Arrange: Through the funeral director contacting the appropriate military service or through DoD coordination (there’s a funeral honors request line in each region).

Legal and Financial Protections

Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA): This is a law that provides various financial and legal protections to active-duty service members. Key benefits include a 6% interest rate cap on pre-service loans and debts (including credit cards, mortgages) during service ￼, the ability to terminate leases (housing or auto) without penalty if deployed or PCS orders require, protections against foreclosure or eviction while on active duty, and postponement of civil court matters or loan payments in some cases. Eligibility: Active-duty members (and activated Guard/Reservists) receive SCRA protections. Some protections extend a short period after service. How to Invoke: Service members must notify creditors with proof of orders to get interest rate reductions; typically done in writing with a copy of orders.

Military Lending Act (MLA): A law that caps interest rates at 36% MAPR and provides other protections for active-duty members and their covered dependents on certain types of consumer loans (like payday loans, auto title loans, etc.). Eligibility: Active-duty and dependents (checked via MLA database by lenders). Effect: Automatically applied by lenders – service members should be aware they cannot be charged more than 36% APR on covered loans.

Free Legal Assistance: While not a VA benefit, many military installations have legal assistance offices that help active-duty (and sometimes retirees/veterans) with personal legal matters (like drafting wills, Powers of Attorney, SCRA advice, etc.) at no cost. Additionally, the VA supports Veterans Justice Outreach to help justice-involved veterans, and there are pro-bono legal clinics often hosted at VA hospitals or through organizations like the American Bar Association. Eligibility: Active-duty can use base legal offices; veterans may find help through VA medical centers or state/local bar veteran programs. How to Access: Contact the nearest military legal assistance office (for active/retiree), or VA’s Veteran Justice Outreach specialist for local legal clinic referrals.

Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA): Not a benefit per se to the veteran, but a law to note: it allows (but does not mandate) state courts to treat military retired pay as divisible property in a divorce. It also provides some benefits to former spouses (e.g., continued TRICARE in some cases) if the marriage overlapped service by 20 years or more. Veterans should be aware of this in marital situations.

Financial Counseling and Insurance: Veterans and service members have access to free financial counseling through various programs. For example, SGLI-covered members/veterans can get free Financial Point counseling (via Prudential). The VA also offers educational resources for managing benefits and avoiding fraud.

Other Federal Benefits and Services

Commissary & Exchange Privileges: Honorably discharged veterans with service-connected disabilities (any level 0-100%), Purple Heart recipients, former POWs, and Medal of Honor recipients are eligible for shopping privileges at military Commissaries and Exchanges, both in-person and online, as of January 1, 2020 ￼. These privileges were traditionally for retirees and active-duty, but have been expanded. Eligibility: As above; additionally, all military retirees (20+ years service) and 100% disabled vets were already eligible. Authorized caregivers of eligible veterans (under VA’s PCAFC program) also have access. How to Access: Veterans use a VHIC (VA Health ID Card indicating their eligibility) or other acceptable ID at base entry and checkout. Online access (for exchanges and commissary delivery services) can be verified via signup with the veteran’s information.

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Facilities: Along with commissary/exchange, the 2020 change also opened up use of on-base MWR amenities (recreation centers, base movie theaters, campgrounds, etc.) to the same group of eligible veterans and caregivers ￼. Many MWR facilities are also open to retired veterans.

Space-Available Travel (Space-A): Military retirees can fly on military aircraft flights (when space is available) at little or no cost. In 2019, this privilege was extended to some 100% disabled veterans as well. Eligibility: Retired military (20+ years) – Category VI travelers. As of 2019, veterans with 100% service-connected disability (and their dependents with ID cards) are eligible for Space-A travel within the Continental U.S. and to U.S. territories (Category VI). How to Access: Register with passenger terminal with documentation (retiree ID or VHIC showing 100% disability) and wait for available flights.

Veteran ID Card: The VA offers an official Veteran ID Card for honorably discharged veterans (who are not eligible for DoD IDs). This photo ID card can help veterans verify their service for discounts, etc. (It is not required for benefits, as the DD-214 is the official record). Eligibility: Honorable or General (Under Honorable) discharge. Apply: Online through VA.gov; the card is mailed after service is verified.

American Job Centers Priority of Service: By law, veterans and eligible spouses get “priority of service” in all Department of Labor funded employment and training programs. This means they go to the front of the line for career training opportunities or job referrals at the hundreds of One-Stop Career Centers nationwide. Just identify as a veteran to staff to receive this priority ￼.

Veterans Crisis Line & Mental Health Support: The Veterans Crisis Line (dial 988 then Press 1, or text 838255) is a 24/7 toll-free hotline for veterans in crisis or emotional distress. The VA also provides mental health care as part of health benefits, including specialized programs for PTSD, substance use, and military sexual trauma. There’s no cost for emergency mental health care for enrolled veterans, and even veterans not enrolled in VA health care can receive emergency suicide care under recent authorities. Additionally, Vet Centers (community-based counseling centers) offer free readjustment counseling for combat veterans, MST survivors, and their families – no enrollment or disability required.

This overview covered major federal benefits for veterans, service members, and families. Always refer to official VA and DoD resources for the most current information, as program rules and amounts can change ￼. Now, we will outline state-specific benefits, which can supplement these federal programs.

State Veteran Benefits by State

Each U.S. state offers additional benefits to veterans, service members, and their families. These can include state tuition assistance, tax exemptions, employment advantages, and more. Eligibility often depends on residency in that state and, in some cases, wartime service or disability status. Below is a breakdown of veteran benefits for each of the 50 states, with key programs, eligibility highlights, and references to official sources.

Alabama
	•	Taxes: State Income Tax: Alabama exempts military retirement pay from state income tax (100% exempt for retirees) ￼. Property Tax: 100% disabled veterans (rated totally and permanently disabled) are exempt from ad valorem property taxes on their homesteads ￼. Other veterans may receive partial exemptions or valuations reductions—Alabama offers a $5,000 property value reduction for veterans aged 65+ or totally disabled (not just service-connected) with income caps. Enrollment: File exemption application with the county tax assessor with proof of disability rating or age/income.
	•	Education: The Alabama GI Dependents Scholarship Program provides free tuition and fees at state public institutions for dependents (children, stepchildren, spouses, even in some cases grandchildren) of eligible veterans ￼. To qualify, the veteran must be a resident of Alabama who was at least 20% VA disabled or died in service (and meet residency duration requirements). Veterans themselves can use federal GI Bill benefits; the state program is specifically for dependents. Enrollment: Application through the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs; must provide proof of the veteran’s eligibility (disability award, discharge, etc.).
	•	Employment: Honorably discharged veterans get hiring preference for Alabama state jobs. Disabled veterans (≥10% disability) and veterans who served during wartime get absolute preference (they’re listed first on registers). Spouses of disabled vets and unremarried surviving spouses also get some preference. State Employment Services: Alabama Career Centers have Veteran Representatives to assist with job placement. The state also offers business license tax exemptions for certain disabled veterans engaging in trade or business (if 25%+ disabled).
	•	Other Benefits: Alabama offers free lifetime hunting & fishing licenses to 100% disabled veterans (or those losing the use of a limb) and discounted licenses for 20-90% disabled ￼. State park admission is free for disabled vets and active-duty on leave. Distinctive license plates are available for veterans (with fee exemptions for Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, former POW, and disabled veteran plates). The state also has State Veterans Homes in Bay Minette, Huntsville, Pell City, and Alexander City for elderly or disabled vets (with admissions priority to wartime veterans). Burial: The Alabama State Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Spanish Fort provides free burial for veterans and minimal cost for spouses. Bonus: Alabama does not currently have a general war bonus, but a World War II-era bonus was offered historically (now closed).

Alaska
	•	Taxes: Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD): Alaska’s annual PFD (paid to all eligible residents from state oil revenues) is not veteran-specific, but deployed military can maintain residency to receive it. Property Tax: Disabled veterans with a 50% or greater service-connected disability are eligible for a property tax exemption on the first $150,000 of assessed value of their primary residence. This benefit also extends to surviving spouses of eligible veterans. There is no state income tax or sales tax in Alaska (so no taxation of military retirement or pay at state level).
	•	Education: The Alaska National Guard Tuition Assistance program may pay 100% of tuition (up to University of Alaska in-state rate) for active members of the Alaska National Guard at University of Alaska schools. The University of Alaska also waives tuition for spouses or dependents of service members who died in the line of duty or were 50%+ disabled. Licenses: The state offers resident tuition to military personnel and dependents stationed in Alaska. Additionally, the Alaska Education Grant and other state scholarships give preference points for veterans or National Guard members.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Hiring Preference: Alaska gives a hiring preference in state classified jobs—veterans with honorable discharge get a 5% point preference, and disabled veterans (50%+ VA rating) get 10%. Spouses of disabled or deceased vets also qualify for preference. Occupational Licensing: Military training and credentials are recognized for some licenses; for example, Alaska expedites professional licenses for transitioning military and spouses. The state also has an Alaska Veteran Employment Tax Credit for employers who hire unemployed veterans.
	•	Retirement/Military Credit: Veterans may be able to purchase military service credit toward an Alaska Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) pension if they are state/local government employees. Also, Alaska’s unemployment insurance may offer an extension for recently separated military members if needed.

CALVIP: The California Transition Assistance Program (CalTAP) extends help to veterans after service with employment training, and the state Employment Development Department has the Veterans Employment Services team that provides job placement and training referrals.
	•	Housing: California runs the CalVet Home Loan program, a state-funded home loan program for veterans which offers competitive interest rate loans (often contract of sale loans) with low or no down payment for buying homes or farms in California. It’s separate from the federal VA loan; CalVet actually purchases the home and sells it to the veteran on a contract.

Many Delaware localities offer property tax credits for seniors or disabled but not specifically for veterans, except some school district credits for disabled vets (e.g., a school tax credit for 100% disabled vets in some counties).

The state provides grant funding to organizations (like US VETS) that provide housing to homeless vets. There is no unique state home loan program (federal VA and USDA are popular in Hawaii). Hawaii does not have state-run veterans nursing homes (though one is under development in Honolulu – the first Hawaii State Veterans Home was expected around 2023).
	•	Other: Hawaii Veteran Housing/Services:* The Hawaii Office of Veterans Services coordinates many benefits and runs some small programs like transportation for disabled vets on some islands to VA appointments. Vehicle License Plates: Hawaii offers specialty plates: e.g., Purple Heart, Gold Star Family, Combat Veteran, etc., often requiring a small fee. Disabled veterans (with certain disabilities) can get a special plate that also serves as a parking permit for disability parking. Recreation: 100% disabled veterans get free hunting licenses. The state also offers discounted camping permits for veterans at state parks. Burial: Hawaii has two national cemeteries (Punchbowl and a veterans cemetery on Hawaii Island) and several state veterans cemeteries on each island (which offer free burial for vets, small fee for spouse). Residents apply through OVS for those. Also, the state provides a lump-sum burial expense payment of $100 to survivors of wartime veterans to help with funeral costs (though federal VA burial allowances largely cover more). State Holiday: Hawaii designates Vietnam Veterans Day, Veterans Day, etc., and encourages events. Also has a “Hawaii Medal of Honor” awarded to families of fallen service members.

Idaho
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Idaho taxes military retirement pay, but as of 2022 it began phasing in an exemption: retirees age 65 (or 62 and disabled) can exclude some retirement (including military) – roughly $37,000 for single and $55,000 for joint filers in 2025, which covers many older military retirees. Younger retirees pay state tax on pension. Active duty pay is taxable for residents, but Idaho residents stationed out-of-state for over 120 days can exclude that pay from Idaho income. Property Tax: Idaho’s Property Tax Reduction (Circuit Breaker) Program can benefit wartime veterans: 100% service-connected disabled veterans (or their unremarried surviving spouse) are eligible for a $1,500 reduction in property taxes on their homestead, regardless of income, under the Disabled Veterans Property Tax Benefit. This essentially is a credit state reimburses to the county. It was recently increased (was $1,320). Also, low-income elderly or disabled vets can qualify for additional circuit breaker relief based on income. Other Tax: Idaho provides an exemption from vehicle registration fees for former POWs, Medal of Honor and certain disabled vets (one vehicle).
	•	Education: Tuition: Idaho offers in-state tuition to veterans using the GI Bill immediately (per Choice Act). The state itself doesn’t waive tuition for veterans broadly, but Operation Education (Univ. of Idaho) is a scholarship program for severely injured vets. State Scholarship: The Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant (federal) and state-supported scholarships like the Freedom Scholarship may be available to Idaho veterans or dependents. National Guard:* Idaho’s National Guard Tuition Assistance provides Guardsmen up to $4,000/year for college. Dependents: Children of Idaho POW/MIA or 100% disabled or deceased due to service may be eligible for a scholarship (the state had a POW/MIA scholarship which covered tuition and fees at public institutions for children of POW/MIA from Vietnam era, and this was later expanded in some form).
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Idaho provides significant preference points: 5 points for eligible veterans (with honorable service during wartime or specific expeditionary medal), 10 points for service-connected disabled vets (and Purple Heart recipients are considered disabled for this). Widows and spouses of 100% disabled vets also get 5 or 10 points. If using a scored hiring, points added; if unscored (like direct hire), by law an equally qualified veteran should get preference in hiring decisions. The preference can be used for initial hiring and also for first promotion. State Jobs: Idaho also allows veterans to start at a higher pay grade in some cases due to experience. Occupational Licensing: Many Idaho licensing boards waive initial licensing fees for veterans and military spouses (per the Idaho Heroes Earned Retaining Opportunities – HERO Act). Veterans Services: The Idaho Dept of Labor has a robust veterans program linking vets with jobs and training, including an annual “Hire a Veteran” campaign.
	•	Veterans Homes: Idaho has three veterans homes (Boise, Lewiston, Pocatello) and a new one in Post Falls. These provide nursing care for Idaho veterans and eligible spouses. They also often have a domiciliary care (assisted living) unit. Eligibility: Honorable discharge, Idaho resident, and need for care. Cost: Primarily covered by veteran’s Medicare/Medicaid or private pay minus VA per diem.
	•	Other: Recreation: Idaho resident disabled veterans (≥40% VA rating) are eligible for deeply discounted hunting and fishing licenses (the “Disabled Vet Combo” license is only $5). Active duty stationed in Idaho and their families can buy resident licenses. There’s also a special big game tag program where a limited number of reduced-fee tags are offered to disabled vets through sponsoring organizations. License Plates: Idaho offers a “Veteran” plate (small fee) and free or reduced cost plates for Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, former POW, and disabled vets (one Disabled Vets plate free if 100% service-connected disabled or 100% compensation due to IU) – that plate also gives parking privileges. Idaho Veterans Cemetery: The state has a Veterans Cemetery in Boise (and a new one in Blackfoot serving Eastern Idaho) providing burial at no cost to veterans and $700 for spouse/dependent. State Veterans Outreach: Idaho’s Division of Veterans Services provides veteran advocates and an extensive guide to state benefits (which include free Idaho state park day-use pass for disabled vets, no fee for a business license for service-connected disabled vet vendors, etc.). Idaho also has a State Veterans Recognition Fund which gave bonus payments to certain post-9/11 vets (when funded by legislature).

Illinois
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Illinois exempts all military retirement pay from state income tax (along with all federal, state, local government pensions, which Illinois does not tax). Also, Illinois does not tax Active Duty pay earned by service members. Property Tax: Illinois offers a robust set of property exemptions: The Disabled Veterans’ Standard Homestead Exemption provides a reduction in a property’s assessed value for a primary residence of a service-connected disabled veteran. If VA disability is 30-49%, exemption is $2,500; if 50-69%, exemption is $5,000; and if 70% or greater, the veteran is exempt from paying any property tax on the homestead. This is an annual exemption but doesn’t require reapplication unless disability status changes. There’s also the Returning Veterans Homestead Exemption – a one-time $5,000 reduction in EAV for the year a veteran returns from active duty in an armed conflict. Specially Adapted Housing: Veterans who received a VA Specially Adapted Housing grant can get an Adaptive Housing Exemption up to $100,000 off EAV. Surviving spouses can continue some exemptions in certain cases (e.g., if vet had 100% exemption and dies, spouse may continue it).
	•	Education: Tuition:* Illinois offers the Illinois Veteran Grant (IVG) which covers tuition and some fees at Illinois state-supported colleges (community colleges and public universities) for eligible Illinois veterans. It essentially acts like a state GI Bill. Eligibility: Honorably discharged; 6+ months of service or served in hostilities; and resident of Illinois six months prior to enlistment and returned to Illinois within 6 months of discharge. IVG can be used for the equivalent of 4 years of schooling and can be used along with federal GI Bill (though not for same expenses). The Illinois National Guard Grant covers tuition at Illinois public colleges for Guard members (no limit on semesters while in good standing). Dependents: The MIA/POW Scholarship provides free tuition at state institutions for dependents of Illinois veterans who are 100% disabled due to service or were KIA/MIA. It covers children and spouses for full tuition/fees at public universities or community colleges.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Illinois grants hiring preference points for veterans applying for state government jobs under the Personnel Code. Also, public counties/municipalities often give preference. The state has a policy to interview qualified veteran applicants. State Employment: Illinois has the Veterans Tax Credit for employers – up to $5,000 tax credit for each qualified veteran hired (who was unemployed or on food stamps), and $1,200 for hiring unemployed Guard/Reserve. Professional Licenses: The state expedites professional licensing for vets, waives certain license fees (for example, one free professional license for application if within 2 years of discharge). It also has “Veterans Conservation Corps” and other employment programs specifically for vets.
	•	Disabled Veterans: Illinois has an interesting program called Veterans Care (which was a health insurance for low-income veterans not eligible for VA care, though with VA’s expansion this might be less needed). Also, the state’s Department of Employment Security has Local Veterans Employment Reps for job assistance.
	•	Other: Veterans Homes: Illinois operates four veterans homes (Anna, LaSalle, Manteno, Quincy) providing skilled nursing and a small domiciliary. Gold Star family members (surviving spouses, parents) can also be admitted in some. License Plates: Many options – Disabled Veteran (50%+ disabled gets fee reduction; if 100% disabled or lost use of limbs/blind, free registration), Purple Heart (free), Ex-POW (free), etc. Parking: Illinois offers the Disabled Veteran (ISA) Parking placard for 100% disabled or loss of limb vets, allowing them to use handicapped parking (the DV plate itself no longer automatically confers parking in Illinois unless it has ISA symbol). Recreation: Veterans who are Illinois residents and 10%+ service-connected can get half-price hunting/fishing licenses, and totally disabled vets get them free. Active duty stationed in IL get resident rates. The Camping and admission fees at Illinois state parks are waived for disabled veterans. Burial: Illinois has three veterans cemeteries (Danville, Oakwood, and a new one underway) plus federal ones; no cost for vet interment and small cost for spouse. There is also an Illinois burial allowance: the state will pay up to $1,000 for burial expenses for a veteran with a wartime service or if they died from service-connected cause (and $300 for peacetime veterans) if their estate cannot pay (subject to appropriation).

Indiana
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Indiana provides a deduction (from state taxable income) for military retirement or survivor’s benefits. As of 2022, the state exempts military retirement pay fully (previously it was partially exempt and stepped up to 100% by 2022). Additionally, Indiana allows an income tax deduction of up to $5,000 for service members on active duty (or reserve) income. Property Tax: Indiana’s Disabled Veteran Property Tax Deductions: Veterans with at least a 10% service-connected disability are eligible for a $24,960 deduction off the assessed value of their property (and double that if also over age 62). Veterans who are 100% disabled (or 100% IU) or who are 100% service-connected due to being 62+ with at least 10% disability, may get a larger deduction of up to $14,000 off assessed value (or essentially full exemption if home value is low). Actually, Indiana has two separate deductions: one is $14,000 for 100% SC or POW, another is the $24,960 for wartime vets ≥10% or any vet 62+ ≥10%. These cannot be combined on the same property. Enrollment: Apply to county auditor with VA award letter by end of year before the taxes due.
	•	Education: Tuition: Indiana offers the Child of Disabled Veteran (CDV) Tuition and Fee Exemption (sometimes called the Remission of Fees program) at state-supported colleges/universities. It provides up to 124 credit hours of free tuition (and certain fees) for the child of a veteran who is a resident of Indiana and either suffered a service-connected death, is officially MIA, was a POW, or has a VA disability rating of 0% or greater (yes, even 0% service-connected qualifies if wartime service). Practically, if a veteran has any VA-rated disability and served during a war or is a Purple Heart recipient, their children may attend state school free. The benefit also extends to children of Purple Heart recipients or those awarded a Bronze Star with valor. Spouses of post-9/11 KIA or 100% PT vets can also qualify. Indiana National Guard Supplemental Grant: covers up to 100% tuition at state schools for Guard members (on top of federal TA). Veterans: Indiana does not have a separate free tuition for veterans aside from federal GI Bill, but the state does encourage credit for military training and has robust campus veterans offices.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Indiana allows (but doesn’t mandate) a hiring preference for veterans in state government. Many local civil service commissions have point preferences for vets. The state has a Next Level Veterans initiative connecting vets to private employers (with incentives). Licensing: Recent legislation waives professional licensing fees for veterans and military spouses for initial licenses. Military CDL: The BMV waives the CDL skills test for recent military drivers. Business: Indiana has a procurement preference for veteran-owned small businesses (a goal of at least 3% of state contracts to veteran businesses).
	•	Military Family Relief Fund: Indiana offers emergency grants up to $2,500 for veterans and families in financial hardship (from a fund financed by veteran specialty plate sales, etc.).
	•	Other: State Veterans Homes: Indiana Veterans Home in West Lafayette provides comprehensive care (nursing and independent living) to honorably discharged Indiana veterans and their spouses. Recreation: Indiana resident veterans with any VA disability can get a Disabled Hoosier Veteran license plate which grants free entry to state parks. Hunting and fishing licenses are free for 100% disabled veterans or those with mobility impairments. License Plates: Beyond the disabled veteran plate, Indiana issues a variety of plates (Purple Heart, Ex-POW, etc.) usually with standard fees (except Disabled Hoosier Vet has a one-time $15 fee then free renewals). Motor Vehicle: Indiana waives vehicle excise tax for 100% disabled vets (one vehicle). Burial: The Indiana Veterans Memorial Cemetery (Madison, IN) offers free burial for veterans and $400 for spouse/dependent. The Indiana Dept of Veterans Affairs can also reimburse up to $1,000 for burial expenses for a wartime veteran (or $4,000 if KIA) if the family’s finances are low – subject to fund availability. Indiana also offers a tuition for children of National Guard who died on state duty similar to the CDV.

Iowa
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Iowa exempts all federal retirement pay for military service from state income tax. (Since 2014, military retirement benefits are 100% tax-free in Iowa.) Active duty pay earned by Iowa residents is taxable, but if stationed outside Iowa, the resident can file as non-resident for that income. Property Tax: Iowa’s Disabled Veteran Homestead Tax Credit provides a 100% exemption from property taxes for certain 100% disabled veterans on their primary residence. Eligibility: Veterans who are 100% service-connected disabled (including individual unemployability rated) or who are former POWs, qualify. Surviving spouses of eligible vets can also receive it. This essentially means qualifying veterans pay no property tax on their home. (Iowa phased out its prior military service property tax credit, but the homestead credit for disabled vets replaced it for those who qualify.) Application: Submit an application with VA disability proof by July 1; once granted, no reapplication needed unless status changes.
	•	Education: Tuition: The state has the Iowa War Orphans Educational Assistance program which provides aid to children of Iowa veterans who died on active duty during a war or conflict (covers undergraduate tuition at Iowa post-secondary institutions, up to a certain amount per year). For veterans themselves, Iowa relies on the federal benefits, but many Iowa colleges participate in the Yellow Ribbon program to cover extra costs under GI Bill. National Guard: The Iowa National Guard Service Scholarship (formerly NGEAP) offers tuition assistance equal to the Iowa Regents tuition rate (max 100%) for Guard members at Iowa public and private colleges, up to completion of a bachelor’s degree. Homeownership Incentive: Iowa has the Military Homeownership Assistance Program, giving eligible service members and veterans a $5,000 grant for down payment/closing costs on home purchases in Iowa (combined with Iowa Finance Authority loan programs).
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Iowa gives veterans preference in appointment and employment in state government jobs and Iowa counties, cities, and schools. If a veteran meets the qualifications for a job, they must be given an interview and preference in hiring. It covers honorably discharged veterans from war or specified operations, plus spouses of disabled vets and unremarried surviving spouses. Licenses: Many Iowa professional licensing boards waive exam fees for veterans, and the state expedites licenses for in-demand occupations like EMT or plumbing based on military training. Hiring Initiatives: “Home Base Iowa” is a state program that incentivizes businesses to hire veterans (provides marketing and benefits to businesses designated as veteran-friendly). Many Iowa communities have become “Home Base Iowa Communities” offering local incentives like property tax abatements or utility credits for veterans moving in for jobs.
	•	Veterans Trust Fund: Iowa has a Veterans Trust Fund which can provide funds for emergency needs of veterans (like medical equipment, home repair, etc.), although it’s limited and needs application through County Veteran Affairs offices.
	•	Other: State Veterans Home: The Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown is one of the largest in the country, offering nursing and residential care for Iowa veterans and spouses. License Plates: Iowa provides a free vehicle registration to former POWs, Medal of Honor, and certain disabled veterans (those with 100% service-connected can get one DV plate free which also confers handicapped parking). Other plates like Purple Heart, Bronze Star, etc., are available with special designs (fees vary, some just issuance fee). Recreation: Totally disabled Iowa veterans can get a lifetime hunting & fishing license for $7.25 (one-time). Purple Heart recipients and those disabled 0-100% can get free annual hunting/fishing combo licenses. The state also grants free admission to state parks for POWs and 100% disabled vets. Burial: Iowa Veterans Cemetery (near Van Meter) offers free interment for veterans and eligible family at a small cost. The state will also reimburse up to $7,486 for burial expenses for Iowa soldiers killed in action (per Iowa code). Additionally, the County Commissions of Veterans Affairs often provide a small burial allowance for indigent veterans.

Kansas
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Kansas exempts military retirement pay from state income tax entirely. Active duty pay is taxed for residents, but Kansas residents stationed outside the state get an automatic exclusion for that out-of-state active duty income. Property Tax: Kansas offers a Homestead Refund for low-income seniors and disabled, but nothing specific for most veterans. However, effective 2023, Kansas implemented a 100% property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans’ homesteads (primary residence), subject to income limits. Specifically, veterans with 100% permanent service-connected disability (or their surviving spouse) and household income under $50,000 can apply to have property tax forgiven (this is a newly expanded version of the previous refund program) ￼. For other vets, Kansas has a “Homestead Safe Senior” refund and notably, Motor Vehicle Tax: Disabled veterans with 50%+ disability can get a substantial reduction in annual vehicle property tax (in Kansas, vehicles are taxed annually as property). Also, active duty personnel can get vehicle tax exemption if registering their car in Kansas while stationed out-of-state.
	•	Education: Tuition: Kansas provides In-State Tuition rates at state institutions for veterans, active duty, and their dependents under various scenarios (compliant with federal law and also Kansas extends to any honorably discharged vet who lives in Kansas). The state’s Military Service Scholarship can provide scholarships to dependents of those who died or were 80%+ disabled in service (covers tuition/books at public institutions). Kansas National Guard Educational Assistance:* This program, when funded, pays tuition and fees for Guard members at Kansas public institutions (as long as federal TA isn’t covering it). Professional Programs: University of Kansas and others offer veteran-specific programs (like Veterans in STEM scholarship support) but on state level, one standout is the Kansas Promise Act – a last-dollar scholarship for 2-year programs in high-need fields, which many veterans utilize.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Kansas law gives veterans preference in state employment. Qualified veterans (honorably discharged with wartime service) and spouses of 100% disabled or deceased service members get an interview preference for state jobs—they must be offered an interview if they meet minimum qualifications. Some local governments also grant preference points. Licensing: Kansas expedites occupational licenses for military spouses and may waive fees. It also recognizes military training for certain licenses (like CDL skills test waiver, EMT, etc.). State Employee Leave: Kansas offers extra paid military leave for state employees who are reservists (up to 15 days for training, etc., which is common). Transition Help: The Kansas Commission on Veterans Affairs Office (KCVAO) has a veterans’ employment services unit partnering with DOL reps for job placement, including a focus on rural vets.
	•	Veterans Homes: Kansas runs two veterans’ homes (Fort Dodge and Winfield) offering long-term care for veterans and eligible dependents. Admissions prefer Kansas residents and those with service-connected disabilities. Cost: They accept Medicaid/Medicare and VA per diem; vet pays remainder or sometimes nothing if low income and high disability.
	•	Other: Recreation: Kansas residents who are 30% or more disabled due to service can get hunting & fishing combination licenses at a 50% discount. Active duty stationed in KS also get resident rates. Kansas has an annual free hunting license lottery for disabled veterans (a limited number). License Plates: Kansas offers a free special tag and registration for 100% disabled veterans (one vehicle) and ex-POWs, Pearl Harbor survivors, and Medal of Honor (with no fees). Purple Heart recipients and certain others can get special tags but with normal fees. Kansas Military Family Relief Fund: Provided financial grants to families of deployed Guard/Reserve, funded by a tax checkoff – still available for emergencies of Guard families. Burial: The Kansas Veterans’ Cemetery System has four state veterans cemeteries (Fort Dodge, WaKeeney, Winfield, and Fort Riley) offering free burial for veterans and a small fee for spouses/children. Kansas also offers a reimbursement of funeral expenses up to $2,000 for Kansas police/fire who died in line of duty – not directly veteran but relevant if vet went into those fields. One unique program: Kansas provides a small bonus for Vietnam War era veterans (the Vietnam Veterans Bonus) for those who served from 1961-1975 and had Kansas residence then—though likely closed now, it was a way to honor Vietnam vets.

Kentucky
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Kentucky exempts a portion of military retirement pay – specifically, all pay from service before 1997 is exempt; for service after, up to $31,110 of military pension is excluded (in practice, most military retirees find most or all of their pension exempt due to that threshold). Active duty pay is fully taxable, but Kentucky offers a tax credit to soldiers in combat zones. Property Tax: Kentucky offers a Homestead Exemption for seniors and disabled veterans. Veterans classified by VA as totally disabled (100% permanent) due to service are eligible for the homestead exemption on their primary residence, which means a portion of the home’s assessed value (about $40,500 for 2025, adjusted every 2 years) is exempt from state and local property taxes. This is essentially the same homestead benefit that those over 65 get, but disabled vets <65 can also get it. Surviving spouses can continue if 100% VA disability was in place at time of death. Vehicle Tax: Kentucky exempts vehicles that have adaptive equipment for disabled veterans (like amputee veterans’ vehicles) from property tax. Also, certain disabled veteran license plates result in exemption from annual registration fees.
	•	Education: Tuition: Kentucky’s public universities offer in-state tuition to veterans and dependents using GI Bill per federal rules. The state has the Kentucky Veterans Tuition Waiver (KIA Dependent Waiver) – actually called the Kentucky War Orphans and Veterans Dependents Scholarship – which provides up to 45 months of tuition waiver at Kentucky public colleges for qualifying dependents. Eligibility: The child, stepchild, adopted child, spouse, or unremarried surviving spouse of a Kentucky veteran who: died on active duty, died as a result of service-connected disability, is 100% permanently disabled from service, or is 100% disabled due to being a POW. Essentially, dependents of 100% disabled or deceased Kentucky veterans get free tuition. National Guard: The Kentucky National Guard Tuition Award Program covers tuition at state-supported schools (up to in-state rate at University of KY) for Guard members, up to tuition for full-time (it’s very comprehensive). Licensing: Kentucky also has a program to help academic credit for military training and waives the testing for HVAC, plumbing etc. if equivalent military experience.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Kentucky gives veterans and certain family members preference in state government hiring. Qualified vets who meet minimum requirements are guaranteed an interview. On classified service exams, 5 preference points for honorably discharged wartime veterans, 10 points for those with service-connected disability or Purple Heart. State Hiring Goal: Kentucky law sets a goal of 5% of state employees to be veterans, and annual reporting is done. Transition: Kentucky has several initiatives (often through KY Dept of Veterans Affairs and KY Career Centers) to place veterans, including the HIRE Veterans Medallion and other employer recognition programs. Professional Licensing: Kentucky expedites licenses for transitioning military and spouses and waives initial fees for some professions.
	•	Veterans Homes: Kentucky has four state veterans homes (Hanson, Hazard, Radcliff, Wilmore) providing nursing care. They also opened one for all eras with a focus on dementia care. Admission priority is given to service-connected disabled vets. Payment sources include VA per diem and Medicaid; residents pay a cost based on income if not covered by other sources.
	•	Other: Veterans Treatment: Kentucky offers a bonus program (when funded) – historically, KY had a Global War on Terrorism Bonus for OEF/OIF veterans (one-time payment like $500) and previously had Vietnam and Korea bonuses. The GWOT bonus ended application period around 2011. Recreation:  Disabled veterans with at least 50% disability can get a discounted Kentucky hunting/fishing license for $12. Veterans who are 100% permanently disabled (or POWs) are eligible for a Disabled Veteran License which covers hunting, trapping, and fishing, but requires a $5 processing fee. Active duty on leave get free short-term hunting/fishing privileges. Kentucky State Parks offer lodging discounts to veterans around Veterans Day and often year-round discounted rates. License Plates: Kentucky offers a variety of veteran plates at normal registration cost. POW, Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, and 100% disabled get initial plate free or reduced and some have no annual fee. 100% disabled veterans can also receive one disabled parking permit plate free. Burial: The state operates the Kentucky Veterans Cemetery System with five regional veterans cemeteries (Fort Knox area, Greenup County, Hopkinsville, Williamstown, and Leslie County). Burial for veterans is at no cost, spouses and eligible dependents for a small fee. The state also provides a burial honor stipend to VSOs for providing honors at veterans’ funerals (to support honor guard teams). Kentucky also has a unique trust fund to assist vets in need (Veterans Program Trust Fund) which can fund veteran-centric programs and emergencies through grants.

Louisiana
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Louisiana exempts the first $15,000 of military retirement pay from state income tax for individuals (for retired veterans with at least 20 years service or retired due to disability) – actually as of 2022, Louisiana enacted full state income tax exemption for military retirement (Act 246), so now military retired pay is fully exempt. Also, Louisiana excludes active duty pay for residents stationed outside Louisiana for 120+ days. Property Tax: Louisiana offers a generous Homestead Exemption for all homeowners for the first $7,500 of assessed value (which is $75,000 market value) – veterans get this like anyone. In addition, 100% disabled veterans (service-connected permanent & total) are eligible for an additional homestead exemption of the next $7,500 of assessed value, effectively doubling the homestead exemption (so a 100% disabled vet would pay no property tax on a home worth up to $150,000). Surviving spouses of those vets or of those killed in action can also qualify for this higher exemption. Valuation Freeze: Also, disabled veterans with 50% or higher disability, and those older than 65, can have their home assessment value frozen (so property taxes won’t increase due to higher assessments). Vehicle Taxes: Disabled veterans with certain service-connected disabilities can get a free license plate (and exemption from certain fees), as well as a sales tax exemption on vehicles adapted for their disability.
	•	Education: Tuition: Louisiana’s flagship veteran benefit is the Title 29 Dependents Educational Assistance (also known as the Louisiana State Parish Scholarship Program) – it provides an exemption from tuition and some fees at Louisiana public colleges for surviving spouses and children of veterans who died on duty or were rated 90-100% disabled due to service, POWs, MIAs, and certain others. This covers undergraduate and vocational school tuition up to 45 months. Veterans themselves use federal GI Bill mostly; the state does not have a general veterans tuition waiver, but public campuses have vet centers. National Guard: The Louisiana National Guard Tuition Exemption (LATAP) waives tuition at any state public institution for Guard members (up to a bachelor’s degree, as long as federal TA not covering). High School Diplomas: WWII, Korea and Vietnam vets who left for service can get honorary high school diplomas.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Louisiana provides a preference in state civil service hiring – if using a written test, 5 points added for eligible veterans (with service during war or ≥90 days continuous active duty), 10 points for service-connected disabled vets, and the same for spouses of certain disabled/killed vets. These points can’t increase a score above 100. Many Louisiana parishes and cities also apply similar preference. State Exams: Louisiana also allows veterans who pass initial exams to bypass others or get priority on registers. Military Service Credit: Honorably discharged veterans get an extra 5 points added to any promotional exam scores in classified civil service if the promo exam is within 15 years of discharge. Occupational Licensing: Louisiana waives fees for veterans for some professional licenses (like HVAC, contracting). It also offers expedited processing for military spouses. State Employee Benefits: Louisiana state employees who are called to duty get differential pay to make up the difference between military pay and state pay for up to 15 days, and can use leave.
	•	Veterans Homes: Louisiana has five veterans homes (Jackson, Monroe, Bossier City, Reserve, Jennings) offering nursing care and limited domiciliary care. Honorably discharged Louisiana veterans (with at least 90 days service) and their spouses (if space) can be admitted. Costs are offset by VA and Medicaid if applicable; the vet pays based on income (and care is free if the vet’s sole income is VA disability or pension).
	•	Other: Recreation: Louisiana residents who are veterans with 50% or greater disability can get a combination hunting/fishing license for a small fee ($4 or so). 100% disabled vets and resident POWs get free hunting and fishing licenses. Active duty stationed in LA also pay resident rates. The state also has discounted gear licenses (like for disabled vets wanting to shrimp, etc.). License Plates: Louisiana offers a free “Military Honor” license plate to veterans for each conflict or award (they still pay regular registration, except disabled veteran plate which may exempt). 50% or more disabled vets can get a disabled veteran plate with free or reduced registration and parking privileges. Veteran Designation: Louisiana offers a veteran designation on driver’s licenses. Burial: The state operates the Northwest Louisiana Veterans Cemetery (Keithville) and Central LA Veterans Cemetery (Leesville), Northeast (Rayville), and Southeast (Slidell) – providing free burial for vets and $750 fee for spouse/eligible dependents. The state also offers an initial copy of a veteran’s death certificate free to the family if needed for VA claims. Other State Benefits: Louisiana has a Louisiana Veterans Honor Medal program awarding medals to all honorably discharged vets. Also, a portion of gaming revenue funds some veteran programs like the Military Family Assistance Fund which provides grants to families of activated Guard/Reserve or other vets in financial crisis (up to $10k).

Maine
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Maine exempts military pension income from state taxation. (As of 2016, all military retirement pay is excluded.) For active duty, if stationed outside Maine for most of the year, that income can be subtracted as well. Property Tax: Maine has several programs: The Veteran Exemption – a $6,000 reduction in assessed value for property tax for wartime veterans aged 62 or older, or any age if 100% disabled service-connected, and for their unremarried surviving spouses. (Paraplegic veterans get a $50,000 exemption on specially adapted housing). The exemption increases to $7,000 for those 100% SC disabled (if under 62). Towns can also vote additional local exemptions. Homestead Exemption: Also, all Maine resident homeowners get a homestead exemption of $25,000 off value after living there 1 year; disabled vets can use both. So an eligible disabled vet over 62 could combine the $6,000 vet exemption + $25,000 homestead = $31,000 off assessed value. Vehicle Excise Tax: Maine waives the annual vehicle excise tax for veterans who are 100% permanently disabled and either specially adapted vehicle or former POWs.
	•	Education: Tuition: Maine’s Veterans Dependents Educational Benefits Program provides a full waiver of tuition and fees at University of Maine System, Maine Community Colleges, and Maine Maritime Academy for eligible dependents of veterans. Eligibility: The child or spouse of a Maine veteran who was killed in action, died from service-connected causes, or is 100% permanently disabled due to service, or died while 100% disabled. There are residency requirements (veteran must have been Maine resident when entered service or died). The benefit covers up to 8 semesters of undergraduate education. Veterans themselves can use GI Bill; the state also has the Maine Army National Guard Tuition Benefit – 100% tuition waiver at Maine public colleges for Guard members (up to bachelors). High School Diploma: Maine will award diplomas to veterans of WWII, Korea, Vietnam who left school for service.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Maine provides that veterans (with honorable service) and widows/spouses of disabled vets get a 5-point hiring preference on state jobs, and 10 points for those with a VA disability of any rating. Maine also has a unique state law where if a veteran applies and meets minimum qualifications for a classified state job, they must be offered an interview. Licensing: Maine accepts military training toward licensing in many trades; for example, a military medic can test for CNA directly. Spouses of military assigned to Maine get expedited licensing. State Retirement: Maine State Retirement System allows veterans to purchase service credit for their military time (up to 4 years) toward a state pension if they become state employees.
	•	Veterans Homes: Maine has six veterans’ homes (Augusta, Caribou, Scarborough, South Paris, Bangor, Machias) offering residential and long-term care. Eligibility: Honorably discharged Maine veterans or those who entered service from Maine, and their spouses, and Gold Star parents. Cost: Homes accept VA per diem and other insurances; vets pay a daily rate which is partially subsidized by the state for those not covered by other means.
	•	Other: Recreation: Maine resident veterans with a 50% or more VA disability can get a free lifetime combination hunting & fishing license.  Veterans under 50% get a discounted annual license. Active duty who are Maine residents can get licenses free during leave. Maine also has special moose lottery chances for disabled vets. State Park Pass: Any Maine veteran with a service-connected disability can get a free day-use pass to Maine state parks. License Plates: Maine provides free registration and special plates to 100% permanently disabled veterans (one vehicle) and ex-POWs, Medal of Honor, Pearl Harbor survivors. Disabled veterans also get one free set of disability plates or placard for parking. Other veteran plates (like Purple Heart, Gold Star, etc.) are available with usual fees. Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery System: Maine has 4 veterans cemeteries; burial for veterans is free and a small cost for spouses/dependents. The state reimburses up to $2,000 for burial expenses for Maine veterans who die from service-connected causes (to families) beyond any VA benefits. The state has also set up a program to support veteran-owned businesses in procurement and a small “veteran farmer” assistance program. Maine Bureau of Veterans Services offers emergency financial assistance as well (limited, case-by-case). Maine also has a more unique benefit: a property tax exemption of $50,000 for paraplegic veterans (with adapted home) in addition to other exemptions.

Maryland
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Maryland allows retirees to subtract a portion of military retirement income from state taxes. Under recent law, the first $15,000 of military retired pay is exempt for those age 55 or older (and $5,000 if under 55) as of 2022. There have been pushes for full exemption, but currently partial. Military pay: Maryland does not tax active duty pay for those domiciled out-of-state (nonresidents stationed there), and offers an automatic 30-day extension to file taxes for those overseas. Property Tax: Maryland offers a complete property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans (service-connected) on their primary residence. This also extends to the surviving spouse of a 100% disabled veteran or one who died in the line of duty (if not remarried). There is also a partial exemption for veterans with severe service-connected disabilities less than 100% if they have specially adapted housing (some counties offer credits too). Vehicle Tax: Excise tax is waived for vehicles purchased by 100% disabled veterans (one-time, for adaptive equipment vehicles).
	•	Education: Tuition: Maryland’s Edward T. Conroy Memorial Scholarship provides education aid at Maryland public (and many private) colleges for: children and spouses of service members who died or were 100% disabled as a result of service, POW/MIA, and also for 100% disabled veterans themselves. Award amounts vary but often cover a significant portion of tuition. There’s also the Veterans of Afghanistan/Iraq Scholarship for Maryland residents who served in those conflicts (including activated Guard/Reserve) or their spouses/children – it covers up to 50% of tuition at public institutions. Maryland also grants in-state tuition to all honorably discharged veterans, active duty, and their dependents using GI Bill. National Guard: MD’s State Tuition Waiver provides Guard members a 50% tuition waiver for certain public colleges (University of Maryland system) for undergraduate studies, in addition to federal TA. High School: Honorary diplomas available for WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Maryland gives a hiring preference for state classified jobs: 10 points added to passing scores for any veteran (honorably discharged), and 2 more points (total 12) for a service-connected disabled veteran (or spouse of one unable to work, or surviving spouse). Maryland also has hiring initiatives: the state’s “Maryland Commitment to Veterans” program encourages state agencies to hire more vets, and the veteran unemployment in MD has been targeted by specific training programs (like HVAC for Heroes). Licensing: Many professions in MD expedite licenses for vets and spouses; for example, a veteran with medical training can get nurse assistant certification credit, and fees for initial occupational license are often waived. Military Service Credit: Veterans can apply military service (up to 5 years) toward Maryland state employee retirement pension.
	•	Veterans Homes: Maryland has one veterans home: Charlotte Hall Veterans Home (in St. Mary’s County) which provides assisted living and skilled nursing. Honorably discharged Maryland veterans (and eligible spouses) can apply. It’s partly funded by VA per diem and state, so costs to veteran are lower than private care.
	•	Other: Recreation: Maryland resident veterans with a 100% service-connected disability can get a free lifetime hunting & fishing license. Active duty (even non-resident stationed in MD) get hunting/fishing at resident rates, and are license-exempt when on military leave up to 30 days. Also, Maryland waives state park entrance fees for all active duty and veterans (via the “Access Maryland Pass”). License Plates: Maryland offers free registration for one vehicle for 100% disabled veterans (and no registration fee for Medal of Honor, Purple Heart recipients) plus a variety of special plates at normal fee. Purple Heart plate has one-time fee but then permanent registration free. Property Tax Deferral: MD allows elderly or disabled homeowners (including disabled vets less than 100%) to defer tax increases in some counties. State Income Tax Credit: There’s a small “Military Retired Pay Income Tax Credit” for those over 65 (or disabled retirees) that is separate from the subtraction and can be applied. Burial: Maryland has five state veterans cemeteries (Crownsville, Cheltenham, Garrison Forest, Rocky Gap, Eastern Shore) – provide free burial for veterans and a small fee (~$765) for spouse/eligible dependents. Also, MD provides a $125 death benefit to honorably discharged vets (essentially to help with burial, though very small). Misc: Maryland’s Veteran Trust Fund can give temporary financial assistance to veterans in need. There’s also a Homeless Veterans Program and multiple veteran treatment courts for justice-involved vets.

Massachusetts
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Massachusetts exempts military retirement pay from state income tax entirely (all federal military pensions are exempt). Active duty pay is taxable for residents, but MA does not tax Guard/Reserve pay for drills or annual training under 30 days. Property Tax: Massachusetts provides significant property tax abatements to disabled veterans: Veterans with at least a 10% VA disability get a $400 yearly property tax credit (Clause 22); 100% disabled (or with certain severe conditions like loss of limbs, eyes, etc.) get a full property tax exemption (Clause 22E for 100% service-connected). There are intermediary levels: e.g., Purple Heart recipients or 10%-90% disabled get $400 off; those who lost use of one foot/hand/eye or awarded certain medals get $750 off; those who are 100% disabled or ALS, etc., get $1,250 off; and then 100% permanent and total and paraplegics get full exemption. Surviving spouses of qualifying vets often continue the same benefit. Work-Off program: Many towns allow seniors or vets to “work off” a portion of property taxes by community service. Also, Massachusetts Gold Star parents and spouses qualify for full property tax exemption on their home.
	•	Education: Massachusetts runs the Veterans Tuition Waiver program – all Massachusetts public community colleges, state universities, and UMass campuses waive tuition (but not fees) for all Massachusetts veterans (honorably discharged). This waiver covers only the tuition portion (which is often a smaller part compared to fees, but still a benefit). Additionally, MA provides a National Guard Tuition and Fee Waiver (100% free tuition & fees at state colleges for Guard members). Dependents: Massachusetts offers the Public Service Scholarship (Mass. War Memorial Scholarship) for children of KIA/MIA or 100% disabled veterans – essentially a full scholarship at MA public colleges (covers tuition, fees, room/board, etc.). Also, children of POW/MIA from Vietnam get a waiver of tuition at state schools. Veteran Education Benefits: MA also has the Train Vets to Treat Vets program giving tuition help to veterans entering mental health professions. Many private colleges in MA also give veterans discounts.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Massachusetts gives absolute preference to qualified veterans in state civil service hiring and promotions. On entrance exams, veterans automatically rank ahead of non-vets (within each score band). If a disabled veteran applies, they rank highest. This is a strong absolute preference codified in law. Public Safety: By law, certain state jobs like police and firefighter must prioritize hiring of veterans (with separate lists for vets). Professional Licensing: MA expedites professional licenses for vets/spouses and can grant credit for military experience. The state also often holds veteran-specific job fairs. There’s a state tax credit for employers hiring veterans (up to $2,000 per vet for hiring unemployed or disabled vets). Retirement: Veterans who become public employees in MA get up to 5 years of service credit added to their state pension time for military service (depending on when served).
	•	Bonuses: Massachusetts is one of few states with an ongoing State War Bonus Program. MA has a series of Welcome Home Bonuses: e.g., $1,000 for those who served in Iraq/Afghanistan, $500 for other overseas service post-9/11, and smaller bonuses for domestic service. They also have bonuses for veterans of earlier wars (WWII, Korea, Vietnam) that were historically given and still can be claimed if never received. These bonuses are administered by the state Treasury for eligible veterans who entered service from MA.
	•	Other: Veterans Agents: Each city/town in MA has a Veteran Service Officer (VSO) to assist veterans – mandated by law. Massachusetts also has the unique Chapter 115 benefits: a state program of financial assistance for low-income veterans and their families, administered through local VSOs. It can provide monthly cash assistance and medical expense reimbursement for veterans who fall below income/assets thresholds (essentially a state veterans welfare program). Housing: The state and some cities run veterans homeless shelters and housing programs (e.g., the New England Center for Homeless Vets in Boston partly state-supported). State Veterans Homes: MA has two veterans homes (Chelsea and Holyoke) offering long-term care, and they have the Commonwealth’s Soldiers’ Homes which include dormitory housing at low cost for vets. Recreation: Disabled Massachusetts veterans (with service-connected disability) can get free hunting & fishing licenses and free parking and entry to state parks. All veterans can get a “Salute Pass” for free state park access (with proof of veteran status). License Plates: A wide array – Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Silver Star, etc., and a special “VETERAN” plate for those with honorable service (fee for specialty plates goes to a veterans fund). 100% disabled vets, former POWs, and Medal of Honor recipients get free registration and plates, and disabled vet plates allow handicapped parking. Burial: Massachusetts will pay up to $4,000 for funeral/burial for indigent veterans (Chapter 115 burial benefit) if not covered by other means. The state has two veterans cemeteries (Agawam and Winchendon) with free burial for vets and $300 fee for spouse. Also a state $2,000 annuity to Gold Star parents and spouses, and $1,000 annuity to 100% disabled veterans, paid annually. (MA is generous: this annuity is one such example, each 100% disabled vet or their surviving spouse gets $1,000 per year for life as a small token from the state).

Michigan
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Michigan exempts military retirement pay from state income tax for those born before 1956. For those born after, Michigan’s tax reform in 2012 changed how pensions are taxed with age brackets. Currently (as of 2025), those born 1956 or later can still deduct some of military retirement, but it’s complex. However, in 2022 Michigan passed a phase-in to fully exempt military pensions for everyone by 2024. Property Tax: Michigan has a 100% Homestead Property Tax Exemption for Disabled Veterans – veterans who are 100% permanently and totally disabled as a result of service, or rated 100% due to individual unemployability, or who are receiving Dependency & Indemnity Compensation (surviving spouse of a vet who died from service causes) are entitled to a full property tax waiver on their primary home. The unremarried surviving spouse of an eligible vet can also get it. Enrollment: Apply annually to local tax assessor with VA certification. Additionally, Michigan offers a Homestead Credit to low-income residents which vets can also use if not eligible for above.
	•	Education: Tuition: Michigan state colleges grant in-state tuition to veterans, active duty, guard/reserve, and family using GI Bill (per state policy and fed law). The state itself doesn’t have a blanket waiver for veterans aside from small programs. Children of Veterans: Michigan’s Children of Veterans Tuition Grant (CVTG) offers up to $2,800 per year for up to 4 years for the child of a Michigan veteran who is permanently and totally disabled, died due to service, or is listed as MIA. Students must be 16-26 and Michigan residents. Also, the Michigan National Guard State Tuition Assistance Program provides tuition assistance up to $600 per credit hour (max $6,000/year) for Guard members, which essentially can cover full tuition at many state schools. Scholarships: There are other smaller scholarship programs like the War Orphans Scholarship (similar to CVTG). High School Diploma: Michigan will award diplomas to WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets who left for service.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Michigan encourages, but doesn’t require, veterans’ preference in public employment. Some local civil service rules do allow points for vets. State classified service doesn’t explicitly add points, but veterans can get extra consideration and MI has veterans hiring initiatives like the Veteran’s Preference for interview if equally qualified. Licensing: Michigan has been aggressive in streamlining licenses – e.g., veterans can get their EMT, mechanical, plumbing, etc., license exams waived or credited with military experience. Spouses get expedited processing. Veteran-Friendly Employers: Michigan has a program recognizing private “Veteran-Friendly Employers” (bronze, silver, gold levels) to encourage hiring. State Veteran Employment Services: Michigan Works! offices have veteran employment specialists.
	•	Veterans Homes: Michigan has veterans homes in Grand Rapids and Marquette (and new ones in progress or completed in SE Michigan). These provide long-term care and some domiciliary care to veterans and eligible family. Some modernization with cottage-style homes is ongoing. Cost: Typically, vets pay a portion of costs based on income; VA per diem and Medicaid cover much.
	•	Other: Veterans Trust Fund: Michigan Veterans Trust Fund is a unique emergency grant program funded since post-WWII – it provides temporary financial assistance for wartime-era veterans in urgent need (like help with utility shutoff, home repairs, etc.). County committees review applications; grants might be a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Property Tax Foreclosure: Michigan law protects deployed service members from property tax foreclosure and caps interest on delinquent taxes (SCRA extension at state level). Recreation: 100% disabled veterans (or those rated unemployable) get a free Military All-Vehicle Permit that allows entry to all state parks, recreation areas, boat launches, etc., and a free hunting/fishing license combo (and free ORV and snowmobile trail stickers). Other veterans can get a discounted annual state park pass (veteran plate holders get $2 off) and there’s an active duty free hunting/fishing while home on leave. License Plates: Michigan offers veteran plates for each branch and conflict (with fees), and special ones: Medal of Honor (no fee), Purple Heart (no fee), Disabled Veteran (one-time $5 fee, then no renewal fee) for those 100% disabled or receiving VA auto grant. Disabled Veteran plate doubles as disability parking if vet has certain conditions. Burial: Michigan has two state veterans cemeteries in development (not open yet), but currently no active state cemetery; most use national cemeteries (Fort Custer, Great Lakes). Michigan does pay an burial allowance of $300 for honorably discharged vets if not totally covered by federal or other sources. Also a $100 burial plot allowance for vets not buried in a free plot. Misc: The Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency (MVAA) created the Michigan Veteran Friendly Schools program to recognize colleges that support vets, and Veteran-Friendly Employers as mentioned. Michigan also has county Veteran Service Offices with varying local benefits (some counties give small property tax credits or extra relief to vets, funded locally).

Minnesota
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Minnesota exempts $30,000 of military retirement pay from state tax for 2023 (this exclusion is indexed and has been increasing, with proposals to fully exempt). In fact, for 2023 onwards, Minnesota passed legislation to fully exempt all military pension income from state tax ￼. Also, Minnesota allows a credit of up to $750 for other veterans (depending on income) and a separate credit for past military service for those not getting pensions. Property Tax: Minnesota has a Homestead Valuation Exclusion for Disabled Veterans. It reduces the taxable value of the veteran’s homestead based on disability: A veteran rated 70% to 100% service-connected can exclude up to the first $150,000 of property value from taxes; if 100% PT or 100% IU, they can exclude up to $300,000 of value. Surviving spouses of 100% disabled vets can continue the exclusion (100% $300k) for 8 years or until remarry, and surviving spouses of those who died on active duty can get the $300k exclusion for 8 years. Application: File with county by July 1 with VA disability letter. Also, Minnesota’s regular Homestead Credit and property tax refund program can further alleviate taxes based on income. Vehicle Registration: Minnesota also allows one vehicle registration free for 100% disabled veterans (plus free license plate).
	•	Education: Tuition: Minnesota has the Minnesota GI Bill (state program, not federal GI Bill) which provides up to $10,000 for education or training for eligible veterans, Guard, and dependents. It can be used for degree programs, certificate, apprenticeships, OJT. It’s “last-dollar” (after other benefits used). Veterans Tuition Waiver: While not across the board, some Minnesota public colleges voluntarily waive remaining tuition for vets. Children and spouses of 100% disabled or deceased veterans are eligible for the Minnesota Surviving Spouse & Dependent Education Benefit, which is essentially a waiver of tuition at public undergrad institutions plus fees and a stipend for books, room and board (so basically free college). National Guard: The State Tuition Reimbursement program covers 100% of tuition (up to the U of MN rate) for Guard members, and Minnesota also has a one-time $5,000 bonus for those who complete certain enlistment terms with education.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Minnesota has a strong law: veterans (honorably discharged) get a preference in hiring for state, county, city jobs. If a competitive exam is scored, 10 points are added for non-disabled vet and 15 for disabled (30%+ VA rating). If no exam, and veterans meet minimum qualifications, they must be granted an interview and considered before non-vets. Additionally, a qualified veteran cannot be removed from a public job except for just cause (giving them extra job security). Private Sector: Minnesota offers a small tax credit to private employers who hire veterans (up to $3,000 for hiring a disabled or unemployed vet). Licensing: Minnesota expedites and waives some professional licensing fees for veterans and spouses, and recognizes MOS training for certain trades (like a waiving CDL test for military drivers). Military Retirement Credit: Minnesota public employees who are vets can buy back up to 5 years of retirement credit for time spent in uniform.
	•	Veterans Homes: Minnesota has five state veterans homes (Fergus Falls, Hastings, Luverne, Minneapolis, Silver Bay and new ones opening in Preston, Montevideo, Bemidji). They offer skilled nursing and some domiciliary (Hastings is domiciliary for vets dealing with mental illness or substance issues primarily). Cost: Vets pay a maintenance fee based on income; VA per diem covers part;  some may pay little if low income or high disability.
	•	Other: State Soldiers Assistance Program (SSAP): Minnesota provides temporary financial assistance to veterans for housing, utilities, and health (like dental, vision) through SSAP for those in need. This can include short-term rent/mortgage payments, emergency grants etc. Short-term Disability: Minnesota also has a unique Subsistence aid if a veteran is unable to work due to temporary disability and is in a retraining program, they can get subsistence funds. Recreation: Minnesota resident veterans with 100% disability can get free hunting/fishing licenses and a free permanent state park pass. Veterans with any service-connected disability can get discounted licenses ($6). Purple Heart recipients also get free hunting/fishing licenses. Active duty on leave get free fishing. License Plates: Minnesota offers many plates; some like Disabled Veteran (for 100% disabled or certain conditions) are issued with a one-time $10 fee and no annual fee, and double as handicap parking. Others like Gold Star, Purple Heart, etc., have some fee but often lower than typical specialty plate fees. Burial: Minnesota has three state veterans cemeteries (Little Falls, Preston, Duluth) providing free burial for veterans and a fee for spouses. The state pays burial costs up to $750 for indigent veterans or those who die with no next-of-kin (through a county relief process). Honors: Minnesota has an annual “Veterans Day on the Hill” and robust County Veteran Service Officer system mandated to assist vets. There’s also state-funded programs for veterans’ mental health and suicide prevention (the MN Department of Veterans Affairs has a “LinkVet” helpline and special programs for PTSD).

Mississippi
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Mississippi exempts all military retirement pay from state income tax (it exempts all qualified retirement income actually). Active duty pay is taxable for residents, though MS allows a deduction for Guard/Reserve drill pay and annual training up to certain days. Property Tax: Mississippi offers a full homestead property tax exemption for 100% disabled, service-connected veterans on their primary residence (up to a home value of $7,500 assessed value which actually translates to about $75,000 market value, but effectively they pay no taxes if the home’s assessed under that). Actually in MS, the regular homestead exemption already covers the first $7,500 of assessed value for everyone; but for 100% service-connected disabled vets (and certain other disabled persons like paraplegics), there is no cap – they get exempt on the full assessed value of the homestead, meaning no property tax at all. Surviving spouses can also continue the exemption. Car Tax: Mississippi also exempts one vehicle owned by a 100% disabled veteran from ad valorem taxes (the license plate for disabled vets covers that).
	•	Education: Tuition: Mississippi has the Complete 2 Compete (C2C) which isn’t vet-specific but helps adults (including vets) finish degrees. Vet-specific: The state doesn’t have a broad free tuition program for vets. However, Mississippi does provide through the Board of Trustees a Non-Resident Tuition Waiver at some universities for veterans or active duty assigned there, effectively giving in-state rates. Dependents: Mississippi’s biggest program is the Children of Mississippi Veterans Scholarship (also known as Mississippi War Orphans) which provides college support (up to 8 semesters tuition) for dependents of veterans who died in service or as a result of service-connected injuries or are 100% disabled due to service, or were POW/MIA. It’s administered by the MS Veterans Affairs Board. National Guard: The state’s Army National Guard State Educational Assistance Program (SEAP) provides tuition up to full amount at state institutions for Guard members (after using federal TA). Also, Guard members get a $4,500 per year federal tuition assistance and possibly state top-ups.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Mississippi has a limited formal preference in state hiring; however, some city/county jobs use a point system with vet preference. The state does have a policy to interview qualified vets. Military Leave: state employees get 15 days military leave for training, etc. Licensing: The state offers a few license benefits – for example, CDL skills test waiver for military drivers, ability for veterans to get electrician/HVAC licensing if they have military equivalent. Spouses’ licensing expedited by state boards. State Jobs Credit: Mississippi businesses hiring unemployed veterans may be eligible for a state income tax credit (10% of salary up to $2,000 credit per veteran).
	•	Veterans Homes: Mississippi has four state veterans nursing homes (Collins, Jackson, Kosciusko, Oxford). They offer intermediate and skilled care. Honorably discharged MS veterans with 90 days service (and their spouses maybe if space) can apply. Residents pay a per diem rate (which is offset by VA per diem; effectively around $60/day out-of-pocket). 70%+ service-connected disabled vets typically have no out-of-pocket because VA covers full cost.
	•	Other: Recreation: Mississippi residents who are 100% service-connected disabled (or totally blind or paraplegic due to service) get free hunting and fishing licenses. Also, resident active duty can hunt/fish without license while on leave. Non-resident active stationed in MS can buy at resident prices. State Park: MS offers a Veterans Annual Entrance Permit for state parks at a discounted rate (around $30) that covers entry fees. Also, 100% disabled vets and POWs get free admission and discounts on camping. License Plates: Mississippi provides several veteran tags. The Disabled Veteran tag for 100% disabled or certain loss of limb/blindness is free (and exempts vehicle from property taxes). Purple Heart recipients, Pearl Harbor survivors, Medal of Honor, and former POWs also get free tags. Other vet or Guard/Reserve plates are available at some cost. State Veterans Affairs: The MS Veterans Affairs Board runs outreach and an emergency financial relief program (not widely known, funds limited). Burial: Mississippi has two state veterans cemeteries (Kilmichael and Newton) offering free burial for veterans and $300 fee for spouse/child. The state also pays a small bonus to war veterans in financial need (subject to legislative funding). Historically, Mississippi had a veteran’s home purchase board that provided low-interest home loans for veterans (like a state VA home loan), but I believe that was phased out in recent years due to funding.

Missouri
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Missouri as of 2022 fully exempts military retirement pay from state income tax (phased in over a few years, now at 100%). Prior to that, there was a 100% exemption for those earning less than a certain AGI. Active duty pay is taxable, but Guard/Reserve incomes for training under certain thresholds are exempt. Property Tax: Missouri provides a property tax credit (Circuit Breaker) to low-income seniors and 100% disabled individuals, including veterans, but not a specific veteran exemption except for POWs – some counties may have their own. However, totally disabled veterans (100% service-connected) are often exempt from personal property tax on vehicles in some jurisdictions (though not mandated state-wide). Homestead for POWs: Former POWs in Missouri are exempt from property taxes on their homestead (per Missouri law). Also, surviving spouses of certain KIA/line-of-duty may also be exempt (recently passed).  There’s a more limited program offering a homestead tax credit for certain senior or disabled, but funding is variable.
	•	Education: Tuition: Missouri state public institutions offer in-state tuition to veterans and dependents under the Choice Act. The state had the Wartime Veteran’s Survivor Grant, which provides tuition grants to children and spouses of veterans who died or became 80% or greater disabled due to combat actions after 9/11 ￼. It covers full tuition (up to Mizzou’s rate) plus room board stipend up to $2,000, and book allowance $500, for up to 4 years at a Missouri public or private college. National Guard: The Missouri National Guard Tuition Assistance Program can cover up to 100% of tuition at state schools (depending on funding, prioritized for first degree). Show-Me Heroes Apprenticeship: A state program that reimburses employers for OJT costs when hiring veterans.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Missouri grants preference in state employment – typically a 5-point exam bonus for veterans, 10-point for disabled (and spouse of disabled or surviving spouse) ￼. Additionally, any political subdivision with a merit system must offer similar preference. Licensing: Missouri will accept certain military training for licenses (like LPN, EMT) and expedite others. Also waives CDL skills test for qualifying military. Occupational Licensing Fees: For veterans with recent discharge (within 5 years), initial professional license fees are waived. Show-Me Heroes: Missouri’s program encouraging private employers to hire vets includes a tax deduction for each veteran hired and training grant reimbursements (as mentioned, apprenticeship).
	•	Veterans Homes: Missouri Veterans Commission operates seven veterans homes (Cameron, Cape Girardeau, Mexico, Mount Vernon, St. James, St. Louis, Warrensburg) providing skilled nursing care. They have a waiting list often. Cost for vets is income-based (about $2,100/month max if they can pay; if low income, VA and state subsidy covers).
	•	Other: Veterans Trust Fund: Missouri has a Veterans Trust Fund which supports various programs like veteran service officer funding, cemeteries, etc., funded partly by specialty plate fees and donations. Recreation: Missouri resident veterans with a service-connected disability of 60% or more get discounted hunting & fishing licenses ($5).  Disabled vets (any percent) also get free admission to state parks and reduced camping fees. Active duty stationed in MO can hunt/fish with resident permits. Missouri also offers a free hunting permit for returning vets (within a year of discharge, small game/fishing combo). License Plates: Missouri offers a wide range – Medal of Honor (no fee, free reg), Purple Heart (free plate, normal reg), Disabled Vet (free plate and no annual registration fee for 100% service-connected disabled). Burial: Missouri has 5 state veterans cemeteries (Higginsville, Jacksonville, Springfield, Bloomfield, Ft. Leonard Wood) – burial for vets at no cost, spouses and eligible dependents for a small fee (around $300). The state also pays a $300 payment to families for burial of a veteran if the veteran was receiving a VA pension or died in a VA hospital and there’s unmet costs (similar to federal, more for service-connected death). Military Family Relief: Missouri provides emergency grants up to $3,000 to Guard/Reserve families when members are deployed (via the MOSO program, funded by tax check-off). The state also exempted from state income tax any military income earned by Guard/Reserve while on state active duty (like state emergency duty). Missouri’s Veterans Commission also runs outreach for homeless vets and women veterans, including some state funding for the Veterans Outreach programs.

Montana
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Montana provides a partial exemption for military pensions: an exclusion of up to $4,690 (2024 value, indexed) of military retirement pay from state taxable income, but this phases out for higher incomes. There have been bills to fully exempt it, but as of now it’s partial. Active duty pay is taxed for residents. Property Tax: Montana offers reduced property valuations for disabled veterans. The Disabled Veteran (DAV) Assistance Program provides a property tax break for 100% disabled service-connected vets or their surviving spouses: basically it’s a graduated income-based exemption for primary residence. If income below a threshold (~$54k for single), a 100% disabled vet might get a 100% tax exemption; if income slightly higher, maybe a 50% exemption, etc. ￼. Lesser disability ratings (50%–90%) also have scaled exemptions with income criteria (smaller benefit). Also, surviving spouses of qualifying vets can continue a portion. Application: Annual application to Dept of Revenue with proof of disability and income. Vehicle: Montana waives registration fees for one vehicle for 100% disabled vets (and former POWs), and provides free special license plates for them, including permanent registration.
	•	Education: Tuition: Montana’s public university system waives tuition for Medal of Honor recipients and for surviving children (under 25) of Montana service members who died on active duty (per War Orphans law). Montana also has a scholarship for children of POW/MIA. Veterans use GI Bill; there’s no general state waiver, but some campuses might have specific vet scholarships. Guard: The Montana National Guard Tuition Waiver covers in-state tuition at state schools for Guard members (12 credits/semester) after using federal benefits. Also a separate scholarship for Guard members after completing initial training.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Montana provides absolute preference in hiring and promotion for state and local government jobs: If a veteran meets the job qualifications, they must be hired over non-veterans (unless another vet is more qualified). In practice, the vet gets a 5% points boost (and disabled vet 10%) on any exam, but also if no exam, the veteran must be given preference in interviews and selection. Public Employment Protections: A public employer wanting to discharge a veteran employee must show just cause, as Montana’s vets have some job security provisions. Licensing: Montana recognizes military training for certain licenses (has a formal program for evaluating credentials, especially in CDL). Also expedites spouse licensing. State Careers: Montana has a high percentage of state employees who are vets due to these preferences and tries to advertise veteran-friendly hiring.
	•	Veterans Homes: Montana operates the Montana Veterans Home in Columbia Falls and Eastern Montana Veterans Home in Glendive (the latter via contract with a care facility). A new vets home in Butte is opening as well. They provide intermediate/skilled nursing and domiciliary in Columbia Falls. Costs are partially subsidized (vet pays based on ability, VA per diem covers a lot; Medicaid also used).
	•	Other: Recreation: Montana resident veterans with 100% disability get free fishing licenses and free wildlife conservation licenses (the prerequisite for hunting licenses). They don’t get free hunting tags, but there’s a discounted $8 combination license for veterans with any disability rating at or above 50%. Purple Heart recipients can also get some licenses at half cost. All vets can camp in state parks for half price. Active duty stationed in MT count as residents for licenses and can fish without a license on Armed Forces Day. License Plates: MT offers many designs. 100% disabled vets and former POWs get free plates and are exempt from registration fees (and one-time permanent registration on one vehicle) ￼. Purple Heart get free plate but still pay reg fees. Others like campaign medal plates are available at small extra cost. Veterans Loans: Montana has a Trust Fund from which it offers low-interest Veterans Home Improvement Loans for disabled and low-income veterans (through MT Board of Investments) up to $10,000 for home upgrades. Burial: Montana has state veterans cemeteries in Helena, Missoula, and Miles City. Burial is free for vets and $500 for spouse/dependent. The state also provides a $250 stipend to counties for burial of indigent vets. State Veteran Service Offices: MT has them regionally to help with VA claims. They also have a small bonus ($500) for post-9/11 combat veterans which was funded by a special account (may have ended by now). Montana’s “Veteran Designation” on driver license is available with honorable discharge proof (no cost). The state also has some unique aspects like fishing events for disabled vets and property tax benefits if adapted housing grants were used.

Nebraska
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Nebraska now allows retirees to choose to exempt a portion of their military retirement pay: either 50% of military retirement pay for 7 years after retirement or 40% for life (if they elect within 2 years of retirement). However, recent legislation (2022) moved to 100% exemption of military retirement pay starting tax year 2022. So effectively, military retired pay is now tax-free in Nebraska. Active duty pay is taxed for residents; non-resident military in Nebraska are exempt. Property Tax: Nebraska offers a Homestead Exemption for certain categories: totally disabled veterans and their widows, and partially disabled with income limits. Specifically, a 100% service-connected disabled veteran or their unremarried surviving spouse can get a full property tax exemption on their homestead. Also, veterans with VA certified 100% disability due to unemployability, and those receiving 100% disability pension for non-service (wartime vets), qualify. There’s also a partial exemption for vets 10% or more disabled and surviving spouses, with the amount based on income and disability percentage. Paraplegic vets or those with certain severe disabilities get full exemption regardless of income. Application: Annually with county assessor with VA documentation. Vehicle Tax: Disabled veterans qualifying for the homestead may also qualify for a motor vehicle tax reduction.
	•	Education: Tuition: Nebraska has the Nebraska Waiver of Tuition Program (also called the Patriot/Nebraska Hero’s Scholarship) for dependents of veterans. It waives 100% of undergraduate tuition at University of Nebraska, state colleges, and community colleges for children of 100% disabled (service-connected) veterans, or of vets who died from service-connected causes, or were MIA/POW. Also, spouses of those KIA or 100% disabled vets qualify for a 100% tuition waiver. Veterans themselves use GI Bill; but the University of Nebraska also has a program to waive non-resident tuition for vets if they aren’t covered by fed law. National Guard: Nebraska’s NG Tuition Assistance covers 75% of tuition at state schools (up to a limit) for Guard members. Scholarships: There are also state-funded scholarships for ROTC cadets and war orphans.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Nebraska gives a 5% scoring bonus for eligible veterans (and spouses of 100% disabled or widows of deceased vets) on entrance exams for state and local jobs, and a 10% bonus for disabled veterans. If no exam, preference is given in interview/selection. The state also recently mandated that in any reduction-in-force (layoff) in state jobs, veterans must be retained over other equal employees. Licensing: Nebraska expedites professional licensing for veterans and spouses, and waives initial licensing fees for a variety of occupations if the applicant is a veteran within 2 years of discharge. It also recognizes military medics for EMT licensing. State Retirement: Veterans who go into state employment can buy back military time into retirement (up to 4 years if in armed conflict and within certain time after hiring).
	•	Veterans Homes: Nebraska has four veterans homes (Bellevue, Norfolk, Kearney, Scottsbluff) offering assisted living and skilled nursing. Under the new structure, eligibility is basically any honorably discharged veteran needing care, with priority to service-connected and Nebraska residents. Spouses, surviving spouses, and Gold Star parents also eligible if space. Costs are based on income; VA per diem and Medicaid offset significant portions for many.
	•	Other: Nebraska Veterans Aid (NVA): A state fund that can provide temporary emergency financial assistance to veterans for necessities like food, rent, utilities, etc. through County Veterans Service Officers (like the MN model). Recreation: Nebraska resident veterans who are 50% or greater disabled can get a Lifetime Annual Small Game Hunt/Fish Permit for $5 (basically perpetual license). Veterans 64 and older get free hunting/fishing permit. Active duty stationed in NE and their family can hunt/fish with a fee waiver if on leave over 30 days at home. State Park Entry: Disabled veterans (and seniors) can get a discounted park entry permit. License Plates: Nebraska has a popular Military Honor license plate series for each branch and conflict (with fees benefiting the Veterans Cemetery fund). 100% disabled vets, POWs, Purple Heart, and Medal of Honor recipients get one free vehicle registration and special plate with no fee. The plate for 100% disabled has a handicap symbol as well (for parking). Burial: Nebraska has three state veterans cemeteries (Alliance, ones planned or under construction). Currently only Alliance is operational aside from national cemetery. Burial free for vets, small fee for spouse/dependent. Other State Benefits: Nebraska offers a $2,000 cash bonus for combat zone service to service members who served in recent conflicts like GWOT (one-time, if they enlisted from NE). They also exempt active duty military pay earned by nonresident stationed there. Nebraska also has an entrepreneurship program for veterans (VETMOD) and some small business tax incentives for vet-owned firms under certain new business development programs.

Nevada
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Nevada has no state income tax, so military pay and pensions are not taxed at the state level ￼. Property Tax: Nevada does not have a state property tax benefit specifically for disabled veterans that exempts their home, but it has a Disabled Veteran’s Tax Exemption which provides a reduction in property taxes based on disability percentage. Essentially, a service-connected disabled veteran can get a certain dollar amount of assessed value exempt: the amount varies by county and disability level (e.g., around $22,000 assessed value for 60-100% disabled, $15,000 for 40-59%, $7,500 for 10-39% as a baseline in some counties) ￼. This can be applied to property tax on real estate or vehicle privilege tax. Many veterans apply it to vehicle tax if they don’t own property. Unremarried surviving spouses of eligible disabled vets can also use it. The amounts adjust each fiscal year. Other: Nevada also has a property tax exemption for any veteran with wartime service (with smaller amounts, cannot combine with the disabled vet one). Vehicle: 100% disabled Nevada veterans are exempt from motor vehicle registration fees.
	•	Education: Tuition: Nevada law waives registration fees (tuition) at state universities and colleges for children and surviving spouses of active-duty military killed in the line of duty. This is essentially a waiver for Gold Star dependents. Also, Purple Heart recipients (who are Nevada residents) get a waiver of certain fees at state colleges ￼. Veterans use GI Bill generally; no broad veteran waiver. National Guard: The Nevada Guard has a tuition waiver for state schools as well (100% of credit fees up to 15 credits/sem). High School Diploma: Offered for WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets who left school early.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Nevada grants preference points on state employment exams: 5 points for non-disabled veteran, Guard/Reserve, or surviving spouse of vet; 10 points for service-connected disabled vet ￼. Additionally, Nevada state jobs are required to interview any qualified veteran with a service-connected disability. State employment: A recently passed law also gives preference in layoffs – veterans are the last to be laid off in their job class. Private Sector: Nevada offers incentives to private employers for hiring veterans, like the Nevada VET Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per veteran hired, $1,500 if disabled). Licensing: Nevada expedites and waives some fees for veterans and their spouses (like teachers license fees, commercial licenses). It also counts military training for certain professional credentials under “Operation Recognition.”
	•	Veterans Homes: Nevada has two veterans homes: in Boulder City and Sparks. They are skilled nursing facilities. Honorably discharged veterans, spouses and Gold Star parents are eligible. Costs are means-tested with VA per diem covering some. Also Nevada doesn’t charge some portion for certain highly disabled vets.
	•	Other: Recreation: Nevada veteran residents with a permanent service-connected disability of 50% or more can get a Disabled Veteran Hunting/Fishing Combo license for $15 (vs ~$75 normal) ￼.  100% disabled vets get it free. Nevada also issues free state park access passes to veterans with a permanent disability (and all Nevada vets get free admission to state parks on Veterans Day). License Plates: Nevada has dozens of military plates. Disabled Veteran plate: for 100% disabled or 100% IU vets, registration fees are waived and if the plate has handicap symbol, it provides disabled parking rights ￼. Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, Silver Star, etc., plates are available with some benefiting charities. Many plates come with registration fee discounts; e.g., the first Purple Heart plate issuance is free and annual fees reduced. Veterans Cemetery: Nevada has two state veterans memorial cemeteries (Boulder City and Fernley) – provide free interment for veterans and a fee (currently $450) for spouse/dependent. Veterans Assistance: Nevada offers through the Office of Veterans Services help with claims and runs some programs like the Veterans in Care initiative to visit vets in nursing homes, and a veterans advocacy and support team. Tax/Fee waivers: Many county recorders in NV waive recording fees for vet’s discharge papers and provide veterans ID cards for local discounts. NV also has an innovative program, Green Zone, that networks support for veterans across services, and offers small business training for entrepreneurial veterans.

New Hampshire
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: New Hampshire has no state income tax on wages or retirement (it only taxes interest/dividend income), so military pay and pensions are not taxed by the state ￼. Property Tax: New Hampshire requires each city/town to offer a Standard Veterans Tax Credit of at least $50 off property tax for eligible veterans (most towns give $500, which is the max allowed unless a higher local vote) and a Disabled Veterans Credit of $700 (or higher if the town votes up to $4,000) for veterans with 100% permanent service-connected disability ￼. Some towns combine them. Also, per state law, any veteran who is 100% permanently and totally disabled, double amputee, paraplegic, or has blindness in both eyes due to service is totally exempt from property tax on their principal residence ￼. Surviving spouses of those vets remain exempt while in that home. Other: There’s also a property tax credit of $2,000 minimum for surviving spouse of a veteran who died on active duty. These credits are applied to reduce the tax bill. Vehicle Reg: 100% disabled vets, and former POWs, are exempt from paying motor vehicle registration fees for one vehicle.
	•	Education: Tuition: New Hampshire does not have a statewide free tuition for veterans or dependents (it’s considered but not enacted). There is however a Scholarship for Orphans of Veterans: children of NH service members who died in service or due to service-related causes can get free tuition at University System of NH colleges. And children of POW/MIA might get aid. National Guard: The NH National Guard Scholarship Fund and State Tuition Assistance Program can cover up to full tuition at state colleges (dependent on funding). Licensing for Careers: The Community College System has military credit equivalency processes and sometimes offers free training slots for vets in certain certificate programs.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: New Hampshire state employment rules allow that if a written exam is given, 5 points are added for veterans (honorably discharged, wartime) and 10 points for service-connected disability >10%. Some local governments do similarly. There’s no absolute preference law beyond that. Hiring Programs: NH has a Tax Credit for employers (up to $2,000 over two years) for hiring disabled veterans. Occupational License: NH waives the initial license fee for certain professions for veterans (like EMT licenses). It also has expedited teacher certification for military spouses. Retirement: State employees who were drafted can buy that time into their pension. NH also provides employment protections beyond USERRA, e.g. state active duty.
	•	Veterans Homes: New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton is a 250-bed facility for long-term care. Honorably discharged NH resident veterans (and possibly Gold Star parents) can be admitted. It’s mostly skilled nursing. Cost is based on ability to pay; VA per diem helps; state subsidizes some.
	•	Other: Recreation: NH resident veterans with a 100% permanent service-connected disability are entitled to a free lifetime combination hunting & fishing license ￼. Also, legally blind veterans get free fishing license. Active duty stationed in NH can buy resident licenses. State Parks: NH veteran residents with any VA service-connected disability can get a free day-use parks pass; all veterans get free admission on certain days. License Plates: NH offers many. Disabled Veteran plate: for 100% disabled or loss of limb/sight, which gives free registration (one vehicle) and parking privileges ￼. Purple Heart plate: no fee for plate but pay registration. POW and Medal of Honor plates have no fee and reg fee waived. All vet plates allow free parking at meters in some cities by law. Veterans Services: NH operates a State Veterans Cemetery (Boscawen) – free burial for vets, $350 for spouse/dependent. The state also uniquely has a Persian Gulf War Bonus ($100) which can still be claimed by Gulf War I vets from NH, and previously had Vietnam bonuses (expired). Financial Aid: NH provides a municipal welfare mandate; some towns specifically have aid for veterans (veterans aid funds at city level). There is also a state fund that assists wartime veterans in need (the NH Veterans Relief - though often that’s administered via town welfare). National Guard Benefits: NG members get a $50,000 life insurance (state-paid group policy) and active duty NG families get free access to state parks. New Hampshire also has specialized veteran license designations and some specific outreach for female veterans and those in rural areas.

New Jersey
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: New Jersey in 2017 instituted a $3,000 state income tax exemption (deduction) for veterans honorably discharged from active service. This is for any veteran (even non-retiree) and is per return (so $3k per veteran taxpayer). Military retirement pay: Starting tax year 2022, New Jersey fully exempts military pensions from state tax (previously they were effectively exempt via a large retirement exclusion if under certain income). Now it’s confirmed that federal military retirement is excluded. Property Tax: New Jersey provides a full property tax exemption for 100% permanently and totally disabled veterans on their primary residence. This also extends to their unmarried surviving spouse (as long as they remain in the home or similar). The veteran must have disability from war service. Other veterans (not fully disabled) don’t get an exemption but NJ does have a $250 annual property tax deduction for wartime veterans (or their surviving spouse). This deduction is small but a constitutionally guaranteed benefit. Vehicle:* No special state vehicle tax issues (NJ has registration fee waivers for Medal of Honor, etc. but no general veteran car tax break).
	•	Education: Tuition: New Jersey’s public colleges grant in-county or in-state rates to veterans as per federal law. The state itself has a Veterans Tuition Credit Program, but it’s modest: it gives a $400 per semester stipend to wartime veterans attending NJ schools (full-time) or $200 if part-time. It’s limited and appropriated funds. The more significant benefit is the War Orphans Tuition Assistance: children of NJ KIA or 100% disabled (wartime) veterans can get up to $500 per year for 4 years of college. This is very small. However, NJ also has the National Guard Free Tuition program: Guard members get free tuition at state public institutions (up to 15 credits/semester) after other aid, essentially they only pay fees. Also, children/spouses of NJ Guard members killed in the line of duty get free tuition at public institutions. Some NJ county colleges offer free tuition to local vets via their own initiative, but not mandated.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: New Jersey has strong preference in civil service (which covers state and many local government jobs). Absolute preference: qualified veterans are placed above non-vets on hiring lists. Disabled vets are placed above non-disabled vets. In layoffs, non-vets are laid off before any vets. NJ uniquely also extends veteran preference to peacetime vets (most states require wartime service). License Credits: The state professional boards expedite and waive fees for vets and spouses often (like in law, the bar exam fee is waived for veterans). Pension: Veterans working in NJ public employment may buy military service credit and also may retire earlier under some older civil service rules for wartime vets. Hiring Incentives: NJ has a $1,200 tax credit for private employers hiring unemployed or disabled veterans.
	•	Veterans Homes: New Jersey has three state veterans memorial homes (Menlo Park, Paramus, Vineland) offering nursing care. Residents pay a fee based on income, around $250/day maximum, but many pay less if on Medicaid or VA covers some. They had issues during COVID but are normally well-regarded.
	•	Other: Recreation: NJ resident veterans with any service-connected disability can get a free hunting & fishing license. Active duty residents (or stationed in NJ) also get free licenses. NJ also offers free beach access (no beach tag required) at many shore municipalities for active military and vets (by local ordinances). State Parks: NJ veterans get free entrance to state parks and forests (recent law made all NJ residents free as of 2022 actually, but prior vets had free camping too). License Plates: NJ offers many, including Disabled Vet plate (for those with service-connected disability causing certain mobility issues; allows handicapped parking). Surviving spouse of vet can keep vet plate with a special indicator. Some plates like Purple Heart have no additional fee beyond normal registration. Tax Breaks: NJ also ensures that if a service member is killed on active duty, their spouse/estate gets any NJ income tax forgiven that year. Veterans Service Offices: Each county has a veteran service officer (state-funded) to help with claims. Notable Program: NJ runs the Veterans Haven program – transitional housing and treatment for homeless vets (two locations). There’s also a PTSD counseling program called Vet2Vet hotline. NJ also is unique in offering a specialized nursing program to train LPNs from among veterans. Awards: NJ offers state medals to certain categories of vets (NJ Distinguished Service Medal etc). National Guard: Guard members get the tuition waiver, and NJ has a generous state life insurance supplement and death benefit for Guard KIA ( $250k to beneficiaries).

New Mexico
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: New Mexico for many years taxed military pensions, but starting 2022, it began phasing in an exemption of military retirement pay, reaching 100% exemption by 2024 up to a certain amount. Actually, by 2024, NM allows all military retirees to deduct their entire pension from state income (for 2022-2026, first $30k was exempt, rising to $40k then $50k; now it might be full). Check latest but likely effectively fully exempt now. Active duty pay for residents is taxable, but NM excludes pay for those who are residents but stationed out of state. Property Tax: New Mexico offers a $4,000 reduction in taxable value of a property for veterans (basically knocks off $4k from assessed value, which translates to maybe ~$100 saving). Honorably discharged resident veterans qualify (can use on home or even other property). Unremarried surviving spouse can also use it. More significantly, 100% service-connected disabled veterans are exempt from all property taxes on their primary residence. The surviving spouse can continue that exemption for life on the same property. Vehicle:* NM waives motor vehicle registration fees for 50% or greater disabled vets for up to two vehicles, and for Medal of Honor and 100% disabled, unlimited vehicles.
	•	Education: Tuition: New Mexico has the Vietnam Veteran Scholarship for Vietnam-era vets (it pays tuition/books if they didn’t use GI Bill; fewer eligible as years pass). The state also created in 2021 a College Credit for Heroes program to award credit for military training. National Guard: NM’s State Tuition Scholarship covers full tuition at state schools for Guard members (12 credits or more). Fallen Warrior Scholarship: Children of NM National Guard KIA get a scholarship covering up to 8 semesters at state schools. Veterans Upward Bound: A federal program active in NM helps pre-college training. Most vet students use GI Bill and also benefit from NM’s Lottery Scholarship (residents get partial tuition after first semester, which vets can combine).
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: New Mexico gives a 5-point exam preference for vets who served 90+ days continuous and were honorably discharged, and 10-point for those with VA disability. Many state jobs aren’t on point systems, but agencies are required to give a hiring preference to qualified veterans in practice. State Employment: New Mexico state employees who are active reservists get 15 days paid military leave. The state also encourages businesses with the Veterans Hiring Preference Act allowing private employers to have vet preference without violating discrimination laws. Licensing: Many boards expedite licenses for spouses and accept military training (for example, expedited CDL for military drivers). Also fee waivers for veteran professional licenses in some fields. New Mexico also has a Veteran Business Outreach Center to help vet entrepreneurs.
	•	Veterans Home: The New Mexico State Veterans Home is in Truth or Consequences. It has nursing care and a new Alzheimer’s unit; small independent living. It’s undergoing expansion. Costs are partly covered by VA per diem; vets pay a portion (less if indigent).
	•	Other: Recreation: New Mexico resident veterans with 100% disability can obtain a free lifetime combo small-game hunting & fishing license. Also, any veteran resident gets a free annual state parks pass day-use.  Active duty resident on leave gets free fishing license. The state waives camping fees for 100% disabled vets in state parks and offers discount for others with disability. License Plates: NM offers one free vehicle registration and plate to any veteran (the standard vet plate), then additional vet plates have a small fee. Special plates (Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, etc.) often have no fee for the plate itself, and disabled vets (50%+) get the one free reg + plate as well. Veterans’ Services: New Mexico Department of Veterans Services (NMDVS) has field offices that assist with claims and also runs the state cemetery program. Cemeteries: They opened state veterans cemeteries in Ft. Stanton, Gallup, Angel Fire, and another in Carlsbad planned – these complement the national cemetery in Santa Fe. Burial is free to vets, $ for spouse. State Benefits Unique: NM waives toll fees on state toll roads for disabled veterans (though I’m not sure NM has toll roads, maybe hypothetical). Also a tax exemption: disabled vets can get gross receipts tax exemption if operating certain small businesses? Possibly not. New Mexico also has a veterans museum (free entry for vets). And noteworthy: NM is one of few that has an official state veteran organization accreditation program so their DVS can directly file claims with VA on behalf of vets.

New York
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: New York does not tax active duty military pay for residents (if stationed out of state, it’s exempt; if in state, you can subtract it). For pensions, military retirement pay is generally taxable in NY unless the retiree is over age 59½, then up to $20,000 of any pension (including military) is exempt under the general pension exclusion. There’s no specific military pension exemption beyond that. Some legislation was proposed to fully exempt, but not passed as of 2025. Property Tax: New York has several optional local property tax exemptions for veterans: The Alternative Veterans Exemption (for wartime service) gives 15% off assessed value, plus an additional 10% if served in combat zone, plus additional exemption equal to half of any service-connected disability rating percentage. This is used by many municipalities for residential properties. The Cold War Veterans Exemption is similar for peacetime vets (10-15% off). Each taxing jurisdiction (county, city, school, etc.) can choose to adopt these and set maximum caps. Additionally, 100% disabled veterans in NY may qualify for total exemption on their primary residence, but that tends to come from the combination of above (if rated 100%, the Alt Vet Exemption gives 50% off for disability plus the 15% war+10% combat = 75% off total, not fully off; some municipalities might offer separate total exemption to 100% vets though via local law). New York City has its own veterans exemption program for property tax similar to state (recently NYC finally adopted one). School Tax:* Many schools in NY now accept the vet exemption to offset school taxes too. Vehicle: Some counties waive vehicle registration fees for disabled vets or offer free metered parking in city for vet plates, but not statewide.
	•	Education: Tuition: New York offers the Veterans Tuition Award (VTA) for veterans attending college: it provides up to the value of SUNY tuition (~$7,500/year) for full-time study to veterans who served in designated combat theaters (Persian Gulf, GWOT etc.). Essentially, a vet who served in combat can get a significant tuition assistance for undergrad or grad study at any school in NY (public or private). There’s also the Military Service Recognition Scholarship (MSRS) which covers full CUNY/SUNY tuition, room, board, etc. for children/spouses of New Yorkers who died or became ≥ 50% disabled due to combat since 1990. Also, Regents Awards for Children of Deceased/Disabled Veterans is a $450/year award for college for kids of vets who died or are severely disabled from service. In-state Tuition: Public SUNY/CUNY schools charge in-state tuition for all veterans and dependents using GI Bill. New York Excelsior Scholarship: not vet specific, but vets can also use the free-tuition-at-public-college program (Excelsior) if they meet criteria. High School Diplomas: “Operation Recognition” grants diplomas to WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets who left for service.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: New York adds 5 points for vets and 10 for disabled vets on state and local civil service open competitive exams. On promotional exams, disabled vets get 5 extra, non-disabled vets 2.5. Also, if using a list, a disabled veteran who is in the top 3 must be chosen over non-vets if they are reachable. Public employment retention: In layoffs, NY law ensures that disabled vets are last out, then non-disabled vets, then others (the absolute preference in retention). Military Service Credit: State and local government employees who are vets can buy back up to 3 years of service credit towards pension (at 6% cost) thanks to a 2016 law that opened it to all vets with 5 years civilian service (no longer just war vets). License/Exam Fees: The state waives professional examination fees for veterans (e.g., licensing exam fees for barber, security guard license fees, etc., are often waived one-time). New York State Employee Exams: Application fees for civil service exams are waived for veterans. The state also has a program to hire vets without exams for certain positions under the “55-c” program for disabled vets. Private Sector Incentives: NY offers a tax credit to businesses hiring post-9/11 vets (esp. disabled vets) equal to 10% (15% if disabled) of wages (up to $5k or $15k if disabled).
	•	Veterans Homes: New York has 5 state veterans nursing homes (Batavia, Montrose, Oxford, St. Albans, and Long Island) and one more planned upstate. They provide skilled nursing and rehab. The cost for vets is below private rates; VA per diem covers part, Medicaid/Medicare accepted; typical out-of-pocket might be around $120/day if not covered by other means.
	•	Other: Recreation: New York residents who are 40% or greater disabled vets get a free hunting & fishing license and free bow/muzzleloader tags, plus free access to state parks (the Access Pass program for disabled individuals). Active duty non-resident stationed in NY get resident license rates. NY also runs a free week-long camp (Camp Saratoga) for disabled vets to hunt/fish. License Plates: NY offers many. Fee-exempt plates: Disabled vet (for those eligible for handicapped parking, not necessarily 100% but certain disabilities) are issued free and exempt vehicle registration fees. Also, Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, and Former POW plates are free. All others (unit, conflict, etc.) have custom fees that often support the Veterans Remembrance fund. State Veterans’ Services: Division of Veterans Services provides advocacy and runs programs like the Joseph Dwyer Peer Counseling program (state-funded peer support for PTSD) in many counties. The state also recently enacted the “Veterans Equality Act” which allowed all vets to buy back pension credit, as mentioned. Bonus: Historically, New York gave war bonuses (for WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam), but those are long closed. However, some older vets or their heirs still claim them if unclaimed. The state does have a Blind Annuity: legally blind wartime vets (and certain surviving spouses) can get an annuity payment of about $2,000 per year from the state. Also, Gold Star parents (of KIA) get a $500 annuity annually. Tax breaks: There’s a small income tax check-off for veterans funds. Housing: State law gives disabled vets priority in state low-income housing and a preference in state jobs. NY also has set-asides (6%) for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses in state contracting.

North Carolina
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: North Carolina began fully exempting military retirement pay from state income tax in 2021 for those with at least 20 years or medical retirements (the “Bailey” settlement extension). So now military pensions are tax-free in NC. Active duty pay is taxable for residents, but NC excludes up to $2,500 of military pay for Guard/Reserve training from tax. Property Tax: North Carolina allows a Disabled Veteran Homestead Exclusion: it excludes the first $45,000 of assessed value of the veteran’s permanent residence from property taxes for veterans who are 100% permanently disabled (service-connected) or receive benefits for specially adapted housing, or their surviving spouses. Essentially, a 100% SC vet saves taxes on $45k of value (which can eliminate tax for many modest homes). Surviving spouses of a vet killed in action also qualify for the same exclusion. There’s no general veteran exemption beyond that. Vehicle Tax: 100% disabled vets are eligible for a free DV license plate (and additional plates at reduced fee), which in NC also means they don’t pay vehicle property tax on one vehicle.
	•	Education: Tuition: North Carolina provides free tuition at UNC system and community colleges for children of deceased or 100% disabled wartime veterans (also POW/MIA or those who died from service-connected illness). Known as the Class I-A, I-B scholarship under the NC Division of Veterans Affairs, it covers full tuition and fees and a room/board allowance. Surviving spouses may also be eligible for some classes. There are multiple classes of this scholarship with different criteria (wartime service required for the veteran parent). Veterans themselves use GI Bill; NC does not have general vet waiver. National Guard: NC NG Soldiers and Airmen get tuition assistance up to the value of full UNC tuition for up to 10 semesters. Licensing: The UNC system waives application fees for undergraduate admission for veterans. Some private colleges in NC have special scholarships for vets (e.g., Duke’s Yellow Ribbon covers full remainder for unlimited vets).
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: NC gives eligible veterans (with military service during a period of war) a 5-point exam preference on state jobs, and 10 points for service-connected disability. In practice, many state jobs aren’t by exam, but agencies are instructed to give preference in hiring. Also, a vet who is at least “as qualified” as the non-vet at top of list should be hired. Spouses of disabled and surviving spouses also eligible for preference. State Retirement: NC state employees who are veterans with 5 years state service can buy military time into their pension at a very favorable cost (only a small percentage cost). Licenses: NC waives CDL skills test for qualified vets, and fast-tracks teacher certification for veterans via NC Troops to Teachers. Also offers credit towards professional licenses for military training. DoD SkillBridge: NC was an early adopter in encouraging state agencies to host transitioning service members internships. Private: NC has a big employer network through NC4ME (North Carolina for Military Employment) to encourage veteran hiring.
	•	Veterans Homes: North Carolina has four state veterans nursing homes (Fayetteville, Salisbury, Kinston, Black Mountain). They provide skilled nursing care at lower cost than private (VA per diem helps). Residents must be NC resident veterans and pay a daily rate (~$120); some with 70%+ SC disabilities can have VA cover all costs.
	•	Other: Recreation: NC offers free lifetime hunting-fishing licenses to 50% or greater disabled veterans (and to certain others like POWs). Also, veterans 70 or older get free license. The state parks give discounted annual pass to disabled veterans and free admission/discounts on certain days. License Plates: NC has a wide selection. A number of them have no extra fees (like Bronze Star, Vietnam Vet, etc., just std registration). Disabled Vet plate: for 100% disabled or certain loss of limbs, and one vehicle registration is free for those plate holders. Purple Heart and Silver Star plates also exempt registration fees. Plate allows handicapped parking if indicated. State Veteran Services: NC Division of Veterans Affairs helps with claims, state scholarships, and runs cemeteries (there are 4 state veterans cemeteries offering free burial for vets and $50 for spouse). National Guard & Reserve Perks: NC allows Guardsmen to use armories as drill halls at reduced cost and has a state pension for older Guard members with 20+ years. Notable: NC sets aside 10% of state contracting for small businesses, but not specific to vets - however they have a target to include vet-owned business opportunities. Also, NC has county veterans service offices supporting state and federal benefit navigation.

North Dakota
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: North Dakota fully exempts military retirement pay from state income tax as of 2019. Active duty pay is taxable, but if out-of-state more than 30 days, some relief. ND also allows a $300 credit for income tax for guard/reserve mobilization beyond 20 days. Property Tax: North Dakota offers a Disabled Veterans Homestead Credit: A veteran with a VA-rated 50% or higher service-connected disability is eligible for a property tax credit that essentially exempts the first $8,100 of property tax (equal to applying the credit to first $200,000 of true value). In practice, a 100% disabled vet gets 100% of that credit; a 50% disabled vet gets 50% of the credit. So 100% disabled means effectively no taxes on a home up to ~$200k value; 50% disabled means half of that ($4,050 off taxes). It’s proportionate. Surviving spouses can continue for 1 year. Vehicle: No broad vehicle exemption, but 100% disabled vets get a free license plate and no registration fee; POWs too.
	•	Education: Tuition: North Dakota has a robust program: The Dependent Tuition Waiver – dependent children (and spouses, for 10 years) of veterans who were killed in action, died of service-connected causes, became totally (100%) disabled due to service, or were declared POW/MIA, get free tuition and fees at ND public colleges or an equivalent scholarship to private colleges. This is pretty comprehensive. Veterans themselves can use the national GI Bill; the state doesn’t have an extra grant except small ones at certain schools. National Guard: ND Guard members get a tuition waiver (full tuition up to the ND Univ. System rate) for undergrad and certificate programs at state schools. Interstate agreement: ND is part of the Midwest Student Exchange so veterans from ND can often get reduced tuition out-of-state if needed.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: North Dakota provides absolute veterans preference in public employment. If a veteran meets minimum qualifications, they must be ranked ahead of non-vets. Disabled vets rank highest. Also, in layoffs, vets have preference to retain. Spouses of disabled and surviving spouses get similar preference. This applies to state, counties, cities, schools, etc. Professional Licensing: ND expedites licenses for military spouses, and accepts military training for some jobs (like peace officer). Veteran Hiring Credit: ND has an income tax credit for businesses hiring honorably discharged disabled vets (credit of 25% of first $5k of wages) and for hiring unemployed vets (credit 15% of first $5k). State Retirement Credit: Eligible ND public employees can buy up to 48 months of military service credit into pension.
	•	Veterans Home: The North Dakota Veterans Home in Lisbon offers basic and skilled care, as well as independent apartments. ND vets or their spouses can be admitted. The cost is sliding scale; VA per diem helps; some pay very little if low income.
	•	Other: Recreation: North Dakota resident veterans with a 100% disability can get a free combined general game, habitat, small game, and fur license + free deer gun license (basically covers most hunting). 50-99% disabled vets can get those at 50% fee. Purple Heart recipients get a one-time free deer license. All veterans (and active duty) get preference in lottery hunting draws. Active duty on leave can fish without license. License Plates: ND offers several. Disabled American Veteran plate (for 100% SC disabled) is free (one vehicle exempt from license fees). POW plate also free. Others like Purple Heart or simple Veteran plate have normal registration. ND also has a Gold Star Family plate. State Veterans Aid Fund: ND has a Veterans Aid Loan program that can give loans up to $5,000 at low interest to vets for emergencies (though limited capital). Trust Fund Grants: ND also uses the POST War Trust Fund to provide grants for transportation for vets to VA medical, etc. Veterans Cemetery: ND Veterans Cemetery in Mandan offers free burial for vets and $800 for spouse/dependent (or no cost if under 12). Other State Perks: ND waives fees for ND state ID cards for veterans. There’s a Ham Radio fee exemption for disabled vets. Also, ND recently authorized a $2,500 funeral expense reimbursement for families of vets who die in a ND Veterans Home or hospital with no next of kin. ND also reimburses some fuel expenses for vans that transport vets to medical appointments. Veterans Courts: ND has a few, and it invests in service dog training programs for vets.

Ohio
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Ohio has no state income tax on military retirement pay (exempt as of 2008). Also, Ohio does not tax active duty pay for residents stationed outside Ohio. Property Tax: Ohio offers a substantial benefit: the Homestead Exemption for Disabled Veterans – veterans rated 100% disabled (either 100% service-connected or total compensation due to IU) are exempt from property taxes on up to $50,000 of the value of their primary residence. That can translate to around $1,250 savings each year (depending on millage). Surviving spouses of those vets (who were using the exemption) can continue it. Other elderly/disabled citizens get a smaller $25,000 homestead exemption, but vets get double. Local Taxes: Some cities in Ohio have an income tax and do not generally exempt military pensions, but some have minor credits.
	•	Education: Tuition: Ohio has the Ohio War Orphans & Severely Disabled Veterans’ Children Scholarship which covers tuition/fees at public colleges (or equivalent amount at private) for children of service members who died in service or were rated 60% or more disabled due to service. It’s a competitive scholarship but usually all who meet criteria get it. Ohio GI Promise: All public colleges in Ohio offer in-state tuition to any veteran (and their dependents) using GI Bill regardless of residency. Some colleges have their own veterans scholarships. Ohio National Guard Scholarship: covers 100% tuition at public colleges (or average state tuition amount at privates) for Guard members up to certain semester limits. High School Diploma: Provided for Vietnam, Korea, WWII vets who left school.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Ohio awards state civil service exam bonus points: 20% addition of passing score for veterans (with at least 180 days active duty, not for training) and 20% for Reserve/Guard with 180+ days or 1+ years of honorable service, and 15% for spouses of 100% disabled or KIA. Many local civil service commissions have similar points. State Jobs: Ohio uses tie-breakers by veteran status if exam scores equal. They also have vocational rehab specifically for disabled veterans (through state and federal coordination). Licensing: Ohio will credit military training for various licenses and expedite processing (like EMT, CDL, etc.). It waives license application fees for vets for about 20 professions (through the “G.I. Promise” initiative). OhioMeansJobs has a dedicated veterans portal.
	•	Veterans Homes: Ohio has two veterans homes (Sandusky and Georgetown) offering nursing and domiciliary care. They are large facilities. Charges for domiciliary (assisted living) are low (maybe <$150/mo) and nursing care is about $3000/mo but many vets use VA and Medicaid so may not pay that fully.
	•	Other: Recreation: Ohio offers free hunting & fishing licenses, and free state park access, to resident veterans who are permanently disabled and who have an Ohio VA-determined disability cod (basically 100% SC or loss of limbs etc.). Also, former POWs get free hunting/fishing and camping. Standard vets can purchase a “Veterans Outdoor Appr. Package” license at a small discount. License Plates: Ohio has many designs. Disabled Purple Heart and Medal of Honor plates are free of any registration fees. Most other vet plates (Purple Heart, POW, campaign medals) are issued for a small fee plus normal registration. Disabled veterans can get a disabled veteran plate (with handicap logo) if 100% SC or certain conditions, which grants free parking at meters and some registration discount. Tax Credits: Ohio offers a $50 credit on state income tax for veterans who served in combat zones during the year. There’s also a state hiring tax credit for employers of recently discharged vets ($1,000 per vet). Veterans Bonus: Ohio had a post-9/11 Veterans Bonus program ($100 per month in theater, $50 per month stateside, up to $1,000, plus $5k to survivors KIA). That program stopped new applications in 2013 for most, except extended for some time for 9/11 and OND, but it’s effectively closed now. Historically also had Persian Gulf, Vietnam, etc., war bonuses. Veterans Court: Many Ohio counties have veterans treatment courts. County Veterans Service Commissions: Uniquely, each county in Ohio has a Veterans Service Commission funded by property taxes that provides emergency financial assistance to veterans, helps with transportation, etc. It’s significant – Ohio spends a lot on county-level direct aid (e.g., help with rent, utilities for needy veterans). Other: Ohio waives certain county fees for vets (like county ID card fee, and some document recording fees). There’s also an Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame program that honors vet contributions. The state provides a small stipend to indigent veterans’ funeral expenses (counties up to $1,000). There’s also a new initiative to give credit to medics to become LPNs faster.

Oklahoma
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Oklahoma exempts 100% of military retirement pay from state income tax (effective 2016 forward). Active duty pay is taxable for residents, but OK excludes any combat zone pay and also $1,500 of Guard/Reserve pay is exempt. Property Tax: Oklahoma has an ad valorem tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans: veterans with a 100% permanent VA disability (and their surviving spouses) pay no property tax on their homestead (primary residence). This is a full exemption regardless of home value. Other veterans can receive a regular homestead exemption ($1,000 off assessed value for everyone) but no special vet-specific partial credit except that the state constitution allows counties to exempt up to $6k value for vets, which they generally don’t as separate. Sales Tax: Oklahoma exempts sales tax on purchases of vehicles for 100% disabled vets (one vehicle per year, I believe).
	•	Education: Tuition: Oklahoma has created the Heroes Promise Scholarship – free tuition at public colleges for children of service members killed in action since 2000. Also, Guard and Reserve in OK qualify for in-state tuition immediately (federally mandated). There’s no broad state vet waiver beyond GI Bill usage. However, Oklahoma does provide tuition assistance through the OSRHE (State Regents) Academic Credit for military training and the National Guard tuition waiver (waives up to 18 credit hours/term at public institutions for Guard members, essentially full-time, as long as maintain 2.0 GPA). Heartland Scholarship: Some institutions have specific veteran scholarships or Yellow Ribbon for out-of-state GI Bill users. High School Diplomas: Provided for WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets left for service.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Oklahoma gives a 5-point preference on state jobs exam scores for honorably discharged veterans, and 10 points for those with a VA disability rating (or Purple Heart). If no exam, agencies must provide preference in selection. And no veteran can be bypassed in a reduction-in-force if a comparable non-vet is kept. License/Certifications: Many boards expedite vet applications. For example, the CLEET (law enforcement) certification training can be partly waived for military police, etc. State Retirement: Veterans in Oklahoma’s state retirement can buy up to 5 years of service credit for active duty (if not already counted in another pension). Veteran Employment Services: Oklahoma’s state DOL participates fully in federal DVOP/LVER programs, plus “Oklahoma Works” centers have vet specialists. Private employers: The state protects them allowing voluntary vet hiring preference.
	•	Veterans Homes: Oklahoma has seven centers (Claremore, Clinton, Lawton, Norman, Sulphur, Ardmore, Talihina) – they have varying care levels (some have domiciliary). Residents pay according to income; VA per diem covers a chunk; the rest often by Medicaid or vet’s payment (capped usually a few hundred a month if not covered by other).
	•	Other: Recreation: Oklahoma offers a lifetime combination hunting/fishing license for $200 to veterans with 60% or greater disability (versus normal price ~$775). 100% disabled vets get it free. Also they get free deer tags. Active duty on leave have reduced price license options. State Parks: Totally disabled vets (and POW/MOH) get free state park entrance and campsite fees. License Plates: OK provides free special plates and registration for certain vets: 100% disabled get a free plate and don’t pay registration; Purple Heart, Former POW, and Medal of Honor plates have no registration fee. Others like general veteran or war service plates just have small specialty fees. Disabled vet plate with handicap symbol grants disabled parking rights. Tax/Credits: There’s a retiree annual state tax credit ($200) for active duty out-of-state to offset losing the personal exemption, but not huge. Veteran Claim Assistance: The Oklahoma Dept of Veterans Affairs (ODVA) has benefits counselors statewide and also runs those 7 centers. They also have a “Travel Reimbursement Program” giving some mileage money to disabled vets traveling to VA appointments. State Veterans Trust Fund: Used to fund cemetery maintenance (two state veteran cemeteries: Ardmore and Lawton). State War Veterans Commission: Represent veteran orgs to advise state policy. Oklahoma Military Funeral Honors Team Stipend: small funds to help volunteer honor guards. Records: State provides free recording of discharge and free certified copies for veterans. Bonuses: Historically, OK had a Vietnam vet bonus. More recently, a slight bonus for GWOT was considered but not implemented.

Oregon
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Oregon taxes military retirement pay, but allows all retirees (including military) a credit if age 62+ and income under certain limits. There is no specific exemption for military pensions beyond normal retirement benefits. Active duty pay is taxed, except Guard/Reserve can subtract income from federal drills. Property Tax: Oregon has a property tax exemption for disabled veterans: The first $24,071 of assessed value is exempt for a veteran with at least 40% disability, or surviving spouse. If the veteran is 100% disabled or died in active duty, the exemption is $28,886 off value. These amounts are indexed for inflation. Surviving spouses of eligible vets can continue it until remarriage. It’s not a full waiver, but a reduction (saves a few hundred $ in property taxes typically). Some counties also have additional local benefits like small additional exemptions or deferrals.
	•	Education: Tuition: Oregon provides full tuition waivers at Oregon public universities and community colleges for children and spouses of veterans who died on active duty, or who are 100% service-connected disabled. This is the Oregon Veterans Dependent Tuition waiver (up to bachelor’s degree, must use within 15 years of HS for kids or 10 years of death for spouse). Veterans themselves can use GI Bill; Oregon also has a veteran scholarship (the State GI Bill) that will pay up to $150/credit at public universities for those who have no federal benefits remaining. Guard: The Oregon National Guard State Tuition Assistance covers full tuition at public institutions (up to U of O rate) for Guard members in good standing. Credit for Prior Learning: Many OR colleges are part of a consortium to award credit for military training. High School Diplomas: Provided for WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Oregon has a strong veterans’ preference law: public employers must add 5 points (non-disabled vet) or 10 points (disabled) to exam scores, or if no exam, they must “devise and apply methods” giving special consideration to vets at each stage. They also cannot pass over a veteran for a non-veteran on hiring lists without a written explanation. Promotion preference too if merit-based. Licensing: Oregon waives initial professional licensure fees for veterans (in many fields) and for military spouses. It also expedites processing. Oregon Apprenticeships: Many trade apprenticeships in Oregon have direct entry for veterans (skipping lottery/wait). State Jobs: The Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs has a noncompetitive hiring for some disabled vets in state jobs (direct appointment authority). Tax Credit for Employers: Oregon offers a tax credit to businesses that hire disabled veterans (up to $2,000 per hire, for vets with a disability who have been unemployed).
	•	Veterans Homes: Oregon has two veterans homes (The Dalles and Lebanon) which are modern skilled nursing facilities. They accept veterans, spouses and Gold Star parents. Payment by VA per diem and Medicaid or private pay, vet’s share depends on income.
	•	Other: Recreation: Oregon veterans with a service-connected disability of 25% or more can get a free combination hunting & fishing license. (Also any vet while a patient at a VA hospital in Oregon can get free fishing license.) Active duty stationed in OR get resident pricing. Disabled vets also get preference in controlled hunt draws and some special hunts. State Parks: Veterans get free day-use parking on recognized vet holidays, and disabled veterans (25%+) can get free camping up to 10 days per month in state parks. Also, foster families of deployed Guard/Reserve get free day-use parking. License Plates: Oregon has many veteran plates; one notable: former POWs and Medal of Honor get free registration for life and special plates. Other vets pay normal fees plus small surcharges that fund the Oregon Veterans Home. Disabled Vets (at least 50% and receiving benefits) can get a disabled veteran plate (with handicap decal if needed) but still pay fees. Purple Heart plates have no extra fee beyond standard. State Veterans Loan: historically, Oregon had an ODVA home loan program (from 1945) that provided low-interest home loans to vets. It closed to new applicants in 2011 due to funding issues. Financial Aid: Oregon has an Emergency Financial Assistance program (Oregon Veterans’ Emergency Assistance) to help veterans in temporary need, administered by ODVA (small grants up to $500 or $1,000 maybe, for things like rent, utilities). Taxes: Oregon does not have sales tax, so no sales tax break needed. There’s a modest state income tax exemption for active duty pay earned out-of-state if living in OR. ODVA Services: They train county veteran service officers and operate the state’s two homes and a state cemetery in Roseburg (and coordinate others with fed). Also a transportation program (DAV vans) and partnerships for veteran employment training etc. Bonus: Oregon had a WWII bonus historically; no current war bonuses. The state does give a small monthly stipend ($150) to certain war veterans in nursing homes (Oregon Veterans’ Aid, only if fed aid not covering). Military Spouse: Oregon recently allowed unemployment compensation eligibility for trailing military spouses who leave jobs due to PCS moves.

Pennsylvania
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Pennsylvania exempts all military retirement pay from state income tax (actually PA does not tax any retirement income for its residents, including military pensions). Also, active duty pay earned out-of-state by PA residents is not taxed (if serving outside PA). Property Tax: Pennsylvania has a Real Estate Tax Exemption Program for 100% disabled veterans: honorably discharged veterans who are 100% service-connected disabled (or rated 100% via unemployability), and who show financial need, can have their primary residence exempted from local property taxes. The need threshold is fairly high (based on income vs. county median, many qualify). Unremarried surviving spouses can continue the exemption. Other veterans can get smaller relief in some jurisdictions (e.g., some cities give modest credits to any vet). Vehicle Reg: PA offers a free registration for one vehicle for 100% disabled vets (or loss of two limbs) and one for ex-POWs.
	•	Education: Tuition: Pennsylvania has the Educational Gratuity for children of veterans who are either deceased or 100% disabled from service: it provides up to $500 per semester for 8 semesters at PA state schools (not full tuition, but a stipend). PA’s state schools also typically offer in-state tuition to veterans, and many have small scholarships. PA National Guard: The EAP (Education Assistance Program) pays tuition up to the State System rate for Guard members (similar to GI Bill) and there’s also the new Guard MPPE (Military Family Education Program) which is like a “GI Bill” that a Guard member can transfer to a dependent (in exchange for additional service). High School Diplomas: Provided for WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets who left for service (Operation Recognition).
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Pennsylvania, by its constitution, mandates absolute preference in public hiring and promotions for honorably discharged veterans. Practically, 10 points are added to civil service exam scores for vets, and 15 for those with a disability. If a non-promo list, a veteran ranks above non-vets even if score slightly lower. In non-civil service, agencies must give preference and interview vets if minimally qualified. Promotion: only a disabled vet gets preference in promotions. State Retirement: Vets in state pension can buy military time if they became a state employee before 2012. Licenses: PA expedites certain professional licenses, waives CDL skills test for military, and now waives initial licensing fees for vets and spouses (from 2022’s Act 35). Civil Service App Fee: waived for veterans. State Employment: PA State Police, etc., incorporate vet preference strongly in cadet selection. Private Sector: There’s no state tax credit but many local veteran hiring initiatives.
	•	Veterans Homes: Pennsylvania has six veterans homes (Hollidaysburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton, Erie, Spring City). They have skilled nursing and some personal care units. Costs are about $100/day for personal care and $30/day for nursing after VA per diem, with some vets paying less if indigent.
	•	Other: Recreation: PA offers a free hunting/furtaker/fishing license for 100% disabled vets (with low $1.97 issuance fee). 60-99% disabled get licenses at a discount (~$40 instead of $100 combos).

State Parks: 100% disabled vets get free camping in state parks (first-come basis). Also, state park entrance is free or not charged generally. License Plates: PA has a variety. The Disabled Vet plate for 100% or loss of limb has no fee for the plate (standard registration still applies, but can get permanent registration if certain disability and need for adaptive equipment). Purple Heart and Medal of Honor also have no plate fee (reg fee still due except MOH is free reg). PA also by law allows disabled vets or organization vehicles marked for vets to park at meters free in most cities. State Veterans Trust Fund: PA has a trust fund (funded by vet plate fees and donations) that issues grants to veteran programs and also emergency assistance to families. State Paralyzed/Blinded Annuity: PA pays an annuity of around $150/month to veterans who are service-connected blind, amputees, or paralyzed. The state also pays a pension to surviving spouses of KIA ($500 monthly). Veterans Assistance: The PA Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA) runs the homes and an outreach program, but claims help is via veteran service organizations funded through grants. They have county Directors of Veterans Affairs who help vets too. Bonus: PA had a Persian Gulf conflict bonus ($75 per month, up to $525) which ended. It has a current bonus for post-9/11 (OEF/OIF/OND) of $500 for those who served in the combat zone and a $5,000 for KIA families, but that program ended acceptance in 2015. Other: PA is strong on veteran courts (almost every county). Also, the state encourages veteran-owned businesses via a small preference in state contracting (3% goal). National Guard families have an active family assistance program with some state funds (like grants via the Military Family Relief fund from checkoff). Another interesting benefit: free or reduced-fee concealed carry permits for vets in some counties, but not uniform.

Rhode Island
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Rhode Island as of 2016 exempts military retirement pay from state income tax (before that it was taxed; now fully excluded).

Others pay normal plus specialty fee. State Veterans’ Affairs: SC Dept of VA provides oversight but each county has a Veteran Affairs Officer to assist claims and some local benefits.

Misc: SC provides state employment preference also to members of the SC State Guard (organized state militia) similar to vets. The state also runs a small Veterans Treatment Court program via solicitors offices. National Guard/Reserves perks: SC excludes up to 15 days of Guard pay from state tax and $3k of Reserve income for training. SC state employees in Guard get 15 days paid military leave. National Guard State Retirement: SC has a small state pension for Guard members who served 20+ years and reach age 60 ($50 per month plus increases for certain awards, etc.).

South Dakota
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: South Dakota has no state income tax, so no taxation of military pay or pensions at all. Property Tax: South Dakota offers property tax relief to disabled veterans through the Disabled Veteran Exemption: If a veteran is rated 100% service-connected (or 100% via unemployability), they are eligible for an exemption of up to $150,000 of their home’s valuation from property taxes. Essentially the first $150k of value is tax-free, which in many cases eliminates or drastically reduces their bill. Surviving spouses can continue it. There’s also a separate program for paraplegic veterans (full exemption on dwelling and up to one acre). Taxes on active duty: Not applicable since no income tax, but SD is often chosen as a state of residence by military due to that. Vehicle: 100% disabled vets qualify for a free license plate (plus no registration fee) in SD and one-time plate issuance for free. Also, they’re exempt from the wheel tax and motor vehicle excise tax on that vehicle.
	•	Education: Tuition: South Dakota provides free tuition at state universities for children of veterans who died in service (or died from service-connected causes, were MIA, or POW) – up to undergrad degree (SDCL 13-55-6). It also waives tuition for dependents of POW/MIA veterans (up to 128 credits). Veterans: SD offers free tuition at state colleges for honorably discharged veterans who are residents and have qualifying service (one year in a war period or received a campaign medal) – up to one undergrad degree (and a separate smaller benefit for grad programs). Essentially, an eligible veteran gets each year 1/2 tuition waiver for 8 semesters. Also, any Purple Heart recipient gets free tuition at state institutions. Guard: SD Guard members get 50% tuition reduction at state universities for undergrad and 83.5% at technical colleges (plus using federal TA). High School Diplomas: Provided for WWII, Korea, Vietnam vets.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: South Dakota grants a pretty strong preference: In state and local government employment, veterans (with wartime or qualifying service) who meet minimum qualifications must be given an interview and considered before non-vets, and if there is an exam, they get 5 or 10 points added (10 for any VA disability rating 10%+). Essentially, a qualified vet gets a slight edge. And in layoffs, veterans with equal performance must be retained over others. Licensing: SD will credit military experience for certain trades and expedite licenses. There’s a program for CDL waivers. Retirement: Vets who become state employees can buy up to 4 years of service credit for military time toward the state retirement (if served during certain periods). Occupational Bonus: Not exactly, but state will pay for EMT certification testing for transitioning medics through its Dept of Health program.
	•	Veterans Homes: The South Dakota State Veterans Home in Hot Springs offers skilled nursing care and limited independent living. Residents pay maintenance fees based on income; VA per diem covers some; if the vet is 70%+ disabled, VA covers full cost.
	•	Other: Recreation: South Dakota offers a free hunting & fishing card to veterans with 40% or greater disability. Also, a veteran can get a once-in-a-lifetime free veterans deer hunting license (for veterans with wartime service). Purple Heart recipients get a free small game license each year. Active duty stationed in SD get resident rates and free admission to state parks. Parks: 100% disabled vets and POWs get free entrance and camping in state parks; others get a small discount. License Plates: SD has free plates (no reg fee) for 100% disabled vets (one vehicle), ex-POW, Pearl Harbor survivor, and Medal of Honor. Purple Heart plate has a small fee. Standard vet plate available but not free. Handicapped parking privileges are separate from vet plate (except disabled vet plate qualifies as handicap plate). Taxes: SD exempts 100% disabled vets from motor vehicle excise tax on new vehicle purchase (like sales tax). Also, disabled vets can get property tax reduction via the state’s property tax refund program if income-qualified, but the main benefit is the $150k exemption mentioned. Veterans Bonus: Historically, SD offered a bonus for GWOT service ($500 for deployed after 9/11, available until 2013). There is currently a smaller bonus for certain Korea DMZ or some after that, but largely ended. Veteran Service Officers: Each county has one to assist with claims, funded partly by state. Other Programs: SD has a veterans cemetery opened near Sioux Falls (free burial for vets, small fee for spouse). Also, in small things: free vital records for veterans, etc. National Guard Benefits: SDNG has life insurance reimbursement up to $1k for Group Life Insurance premiums, and a state retirement pension for those with 20+ years in NG.

Tennessee
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Tennessee has no state income tax on wages or retirement, only tax on interest/dividends (which is phasing out fully by 2021). So military pay and pensions are not taxed by TN. Property Tax: Tennessee offers a property tax relief program for disabled veterans: 100% permanently disabled service-connected veterans (or veterans rated 100% via IU, or certain loss of limbs/blind, or 100% pension) get reimbursement of property tax on the first $175,000 of home value. Essentially, they pay zero tax on that portion (state pays it). Surviving spouses of such vets or those killed in action also qualify on first $175k. If home value above that, the portion of tax on remainder must be paid. Also, surviving spouses of a veteran who was disabled but has since died continue to qualify, so long as not remarried. Sales Tax: No special veterans exemption (except for adaptive equipment perhaps). Vehicle registration fees: One free vehicle reg for 100% disabled vets in TN and free plates for Medal of Honor, POW, Purple Heart.
	•	Education: Tuition: Tennessee provides free tuition/fees at state public colleges to the spouse and children of veterans who are permanently 100% disabled, died in action, or died from service-connected cause, or were declared missing/killed in action. This is through the Dependent Children Scholarship (aka Helping Heroes Grant) and applies to UT system, state universities, and community colleges. It covers tuition/fees for up to 8 semesters. (Also children of POW or MIA get free tuition even if not deceased). For veterans, TN has the Tennessee Reconnect which is not vet-specific but allows adults (like vets) to attend community college free if they haven’t earned a degree. National Guard: TN STRONG Act tuition funding covers 100% tuition for Guard members at state schools. Diplomas: Provided for certain war vets leaving school early.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Tennessee allows but doesn’t mandate veterans preference in state hiring; however, many local civil service do (like Memphis police, etc.). State and local jobs often add 5 points for vets, 10 for disabled on exams by policy. Hiring Initiatives: The state’s Department of Labor has the established Jobs4TN vets portal, and state HR will flag veteran applicants to agencies. Licensing: TN expedites and often waives test requirements for some licenses (like trades, CDL). They also waive initial license fees for veterans (per law in 2016). Pension: For state retirement, war veterans employed by state can get up to 4 years service credit for military time at no cost. Private Sector: TN offers a small $5,000 grant to small businesses 51%+ owned by service-disabled vets through their rural development fund.
	•	Veterans Homes: Tennessee has four state veterans homes (Murfreesboro, Humboldt, Knoxville, Clarksville (just opened)). They are skilled nursing facilities. They are self-funded mostly via VA per diem and resident payments/Medicaid. They charge a daily rate (~$340) but VA covers $117, Medicaid the rest often, so many vets pay little out-of-pocket.
	•	Other: Recreation: Tennessee resident veterans with 30% or greater disability can get discounted hunting/fishing licenses ($10). 100% disabled and former POWs get free lifetime combo licenses. Also 100% disabled vets get one free state park annual pass (discount on camping too), others get discounts on camping fees on certain days. License Plates: TN offers free plates (and free registration) to 100% disabled vets (limit one), ex-POWs, Pearl Harbor, and Medal of Honor. Purple Heart recipients get free plate (reg fee still applies after first issue though, I think they recently waived renewal too). Standard veteran plates cost $21 and that portion goes to state veterans fund. Disabled vet plate qualifies as handicap plate. Taxes: TN also exempts 100% disabled vets (and KIA surviving spouse) from motor vehicle sales/use tax on one vehicle purchase. Veteran Services: TDVS has reps assisting claims and runs an active employment bridging program (HERO2Hired etc.). Also the state has a Veterans Treatment Court network with support from state VA. Women Veterans: TN has a state Women Veterans Summit each year. Bonuses: Historically had Vietnam and earlier war bonuses. In 2022, one county gave an Afghan/Iraq bonus but not statewide. National Guard: TN Guard gets free license plates, state active duty death benefits, etc.

Texas
	•	Taxes: Income Tax: Texas has no state income tax, so no tax on military pay or retirement. Property Tax: Texas offers one of the most robust veteran property benefits:  100% disabled veterans (service-connected) are fully exempt from all property taxes on their primary residence ￼. Veterans with less than 100% disability get partial exemptions: from $5,000 off assessed value (for 10-29% disability) up to $12,000 off (70-100% but not total) ￼. Additionally, veterans 65+ with at least 10% disability get a $12,000 exemption. These can stack with general homestead exemptions. Surviving spouses of 100% disabled can retain a full exemption for the same home or a subsequent one up to equivalent value ￼. Surviving spouses of service members killed in action also get total exemption. Vehicle: Texas waives vehicle registration fees for recipients of Medal of Honor, some for Purple Heart, and 50% disabled vets get a discounted registration. But main is property tax.
	•	Education: Tuition: Texas has the Hazlewood Act which provides up to 150 credit hours of free tuition at Texas public universities for eligible Texas veterans (who served at least 181 days active, honorable discharge, and entered service from TX or were TX resident) ￼. Hazlewood can also be used by their dependents in two ways: Hazlewood Legacy allows a veteran to transfer unused hours to a child ￼; and Hazlewood for spouses/children of 100% disabled or KIA covers their tuition independently ￼. It’s a significant benefit, effectively free tuition (not fees) after GI Bill is exhausted or for those not GI Bill eligible. Guard: TX provides the Tuition Assistance for Texas Guard, and a separate State Tuition Reimbursement (STR) for those who used federal TA. Also, Texas has the Hazelwood for Guard too if they meet the qualifications.
	•	Employment: Veterans’ Preference: Texas state agencies and local governments must practice veteran preference in hiring: if a veteran meets minimum qualifications, they get an interview; and if finalists are equally qualified, preference to the vet (especially disabled vet). There’s also a 5/10 point scoring if applicable. License: Texas expedites and waives a lot of fees for vets (recent law removed application fees for many occupation licenses for veterans). Also, credit for military experience in many fields (like journeyman trades, law enforcement). State Retirement: Vets can buy up to 60 months of military time into state retirement (the state even passed paying 100% of the cost for some combat vets to buy time). Occupational Tools: Texas has the Veteran Entrepreneur Program to assist business startups. Contracting:  Texas has a 20% goal of state contracting with HUBs (historically underutilized businesses), and veteran-owned qualifies in that category.
	•	Veterans Homes: Texas has 9 state veterans homes across the state (operated by TX Veterans Land Board). They provide skilled nursing and some memory care. They have a per diem from VA; cost to vet is generally below market. They also accept Medicare/Medicaid.
	•	Other: Recreation: Texas offers free or discounted specialty hunting/fishing licenses to disabled vets: free “Super Combo” (all-inclusive license) for 50%+ disabled or loss of limb or 100% and for active duty on leave ￼. Also, free entry to state parks with the “Disabled Vet Super Combo” pass. “Hunt for Heroes” and such programs exist. License Plates: TX has numerous. Disabled veterans (50%+ or loss of foot/hand/sight) get a DV plate with no registration fee ￼. They also have specialty parking privileges (can park in any handicapped or veteran reserved spot, toll fee waivers in some places). Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, and some others have free plates as well and toll exemptions. Veterans Land Board: A Texas-specific benefit: the VLB offers below-market interest rate land loans (up to $150k) and home improvement loans for Texas veterans ￼. Also a VLB home loan program, although overlapping with VA, was unique but now somewhat redundant with VA, except it can be used as a second mortgage. State Veterans Cemetery: Texas has 4 state cemeteries (Abilene, Corpus Christi, Killeen, Mission) with free burial for vets and a small fee for spouse/child. Hazlewood Act is probably the biggest one. Also, Texas laws give veterans hiring preference in private sector (for ex, they allow private employers to have vet preference explicitly). Texas Veterans Commission helps with claims and also runs a Fund for Veterans Assistance giving grants to veteran support nonprofits (money partly from lottery). Tax*: Texas is working on adjusting the disabled vet property benefit as so many use it for 100% we may see upcoming changes but likely remain generous.

Underutilized U.S. Veteran Benefits: A Comprehensive Overview

Many benefits are available to U.S. military veterans at the federal and state levels – spanning healthcare, education, housing, employment, and financial assistance – yet a significant portion go underused. In fact, in FY2021 only about 52% of the nation’s ~19 million veterans used any VA benefit or service, meaning nearly half did not access any benefits they earned ￼. This report identifies major veteran programs that are especially underutilized, supported by participation statistics where available. It also examines why these benefits see low uptake – from lack of awareness and confusing eligibility rules to stigma and administrative hurdles. All programs discussed are current and active (no legacy or discontinued benefits). A summary table is included at the end for quick reference.

Underutilized Healthcare Benefits

VA Health Care Enrollment and Services: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides comprehensive medical benefits, yet many veterans do not utilize VA healthcare. More than 9 million veterans are enrolled in VA health care, but this represents only about half of the total U.S. veteran population ￼. Even among those enrolled, not all seek care regularly – for example, in one recent year only 6.8 million veterans were active VA healthcare users out of ~10.9 million enrolled ￼. This means millions of veterans (especially those without service-connected disabilities or those who have private insurance) forego VA medical services. Key reasons include lack of awareness about eligibility, perceived ineligibility, or preference for other healthcare. Some veterans mistakenly believe they must have a service-related injury or low income to use VA health care, when in fact many qualify for basic VA medical coverage by virtue of their service. Others simply have not enrolled because they haven’t needed care yet or find the process daunting.

Mental Health Services: Mental health care is a critical subset of healthcare benefits that is markedly underutilized due to stigma and other barriers. Estimates indicate roughly 60% of veterans who could benefit from mental health treatment do not seek it ￼. One survey found about half of recent combat veterans with significant psychological symptoms had not accessed mental health services at all ￼. The VA offers counseling, therapy for post-traumatic stress (PTS), substance abuse programs, military sexual trauma (MST) counseling, and more – often at no cost – but many veterans avoid or delay getting help. Stigma (the fear of being seen as “weak” or concerns about one’s reputation) is a well-documented factor deterring veterans from mental health care ￼. Additionally, some veterans are simply unaware that Vet Centers and VA clinics provide confidential counseling (even for those not enrolled in VA healthcare). The result is underuse of life-improving services – a gap policymakers continue to tackle through anti-stigma campaigns and outreach.

Caregiver Support Program: The VA’s Caregiver Support Program (CSP) – including training, peer support, respite care, and for some, a monthly stipend – is another underused healthcare-related benefit. It is designed to support family members who care for seriously injured or ill veterans. While exact participation rates are not widely publicized, anecdotal evidence suggests many eligible veterans and caregivers are not tapped into this program. Lack of awareness is a prime issue: caregivers often do not know the VA offers coaching, a support line, and even financial assistance. Until recently, the comprehensive stipend portion was limited to post-9/11 veteran caregivers, which left many feeling ineligible; even after expanding to earlier eras, reaching those newly eligible caregivers has been challenging. Administrative complexity also plays a role – the application process and criteria for approval can be confusing. In short, this valuable support system remains underutilized because many caregivers either don’t know it exists or find the rules daunting.

Underutilized Education & Employment Benefits

Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E): VR&E (formerly Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment, or “voc rehab”) is a federal program that helps service-connected disabled veterans train for new careers, pursue education, or otherwise become employable. By all accounts, VR&E is far less utilized than the GI Bill education benefits. For example, in recent years about 125,000 veterans were using VR&E (Chapter 31) benefits, compared to roughly 900,000 using the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) in school – only about 14% as many ￼. This disparity suggests that many veterans with service-connected disabilities who could benefit from career retraining are not participating. Reasons include lack of awareness of VR&E’s existence, confusion about eligibility (some vets assume VR&E is only for the most severely disabled or only for those who also use GI Bill, which is not the case), and the fact that VR&E’s monthly stipend is often lower than the GI Bill’s housing allowance. Veterans may gravitate to the GI Bill for college since it’s better known and generally more generous, even if VR&E’s specialized career services might suit their needs better. Efforts by VA and veterans’ groups are ongoing to better promote VR&E, as it’s considered an “underutilized” tool for long-term employment success ￼.

On-the-Job Training and Apprenticeships (GI Bill): Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, veterans can use their benefits not only for college, but also for registered apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs. This option, however, is especially underused. Most GI Bill users enroll in colleges or universities, while relatively few pursue apprenticeships – in part because the benefit payout for apprentices is much smaller. For instance, a veteran apprentice might receive only a few thousand dollars per year (housing stipend and a books/tools allowance), whereas a full-time student could leverage tens of thousands in tuition and housing coverage ￼ ￼. One analysis noted that a veteran who chooses a three-year apprenticeship in Washington D.C. could end up leaving $134,000 in GI Bill benefits unused compared to what they’d get by attending a four-year private university ￼. This financial imbalance (a structural issue in the program) makes the apprenticeship route far less attractive, thus underutilized. Awareness is also a factor – many separating service members aren’t informed that GI Bill benefits can fund trade apprenticeships or employer training with a living stipend. In sum, the GI Bill’s apprenticeship/OJT programs remain a little-known, underutilized avenue, due largely to benefit design and limited outreach.

State Educational Benefits: Beyond federal programs, many states offer education benefits for veterans and their families – and these too often see limited uptake. Common examples are state veteran scholarship programs or tuition waivers. For instance, Florida waives undergraduate tuition at public colleges for recipients of the Purple Heart or certain other combat decorations, yet relatively few eligible veterans have used this benefit ￼. Similarly, Maine provides a 100% tuition and fee waiver at state universities and community colleges for spouses and children of veterans who are 100% permanently disabled, but this program’s usage is modest relative to the number of potentially eligible dependents ￼. These state programs tend to be underutilized mainly because of limited awareness – they often aren’t well-publicized outside of state VA websites or pamphlets. Eligibility criteria can also be specific (e.g. tied to residency or specific medals), so confusion or narrow targeting means only a small pool benefits. The nationwide trend is that state-level educational benefits for veterans (or their children) often have low participation rates, unless a concerted outreach effort is made within the state.

Employment and Transition Assistance: Veterans are eligible for various employment-related benefits that often go under-the-radar. One example is hiring preference in government jobs – veterans receive points or preference for federal (and some state) job openings. While this is a guaranteed benefit, many veterans don’t fully leverage it: some are not aware of how to claim preference points on applications, and others simply do not pursue public-sector jobs. Likewise, programs like the Department of Labor’s Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program (DVOP) specialists at local career centers exist to help veterans find jobs, but these services can be underused if vets job-hunt on their own without realizing specialized help is available. At the state level, some states incentivize private employers to hire veterans (for example, Maryland offers an income tax credit to employers for hiring a veteran ￼), yet these incentives are only effective if employers know about them – many do not, meaning the programs don’t reach their full potential. In summary, while veteran unemployment is relatively low, the dedicated employment assistance programs and hiring advantages in place could serve a larger share of veterans than they currently do.

Underutilized Housing Benefits

VA Home Loan Guaranty: The VA home loan benefit is often cited as one of the most underutilized federal veteran benefits. VA-backed mortgages allow veterans to buy homes with zero down payment, no private mortgage insurance, and competitive interest rates – an enormous advantage. However, uptake is lower than one might expect. Only about 24% of eligible veteran homeowners are currently using a VA home loan, meaning roughly 76% of veteran homeowners are not using their VA loan benefit ￼. Many veterans either finance their homes with conventional loans or are unaware they even qualify for a VA loan. Lack of awareness is a major factor – surveys have found many veterans are simply not informed about the home loan benefit or its scope ￼ ￼. One retired Air Force veteran noted that “many veterans are simply unaware of the benefits they have or the extent to which the [VA home loan] benefit reaches” ￼. Additionally, some perceive the VA loan process as more cumbersome: VA appraisals and inspections can be stricter and take longer than standard real estate transactions ￼. In hot housing markets, myths about VA loans (e.g. that they’re slower or less likely to close) lead some sellers and realtors to shy away from VA offers ￼, indirectly discouraging veteran buyers. These factors – knowledge gaps, perceived administrative hurdles, and marketplace bias – contribute to underuse of a very valuable housing benefit.

Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grants: Severely injured or disabled veterans may qualify for VA grants to adapt or purchase housing to accommodate their disabilities (for example, widening doorways for wheelchair access or installing ramps). While thousands have benefited from Specially Adapted Housing grants and the related Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grants, these programs are believed to be underutilized relative to the need. Lack of awareness is again the primary culprit: many disabled veterans and even their VA healthcare providers may not realize that tens of thousands of dollars are available to modify a home for accessibility ￼. The application process for SAH grants can also be complex, requiring documentation of service-connected disabilities and homeownership or plans to build a suitable home. Some veterans who rent or live with family might assume they can’t use the benefit (in fact, there are ways to use grants for a family member’s home in which the vet lives, but this is not widely known). According to one veterans housing organization, multiple housing assistance programs exist to help veterans “age in place” or live independently, but “some housing assistance programs are underutilized primarily because of lack of awareness”, including the VA’s adaptation grants ￼. In short, the SAH/SHA benefits have life-changing potential but reach only a fraction of eligible vets.

State Housing Programs: Several states offer unique housing-related benefits that see limited use. For example, Alaska allows veterans a 20% discount on purchases of state land for recreational or residential use – a valuable benefit on paper that “many veterans do not take advantage of because they save it to use for a later time” (and some never use it at all) ￼. Mississippi runs a Veterans’ Home Purchase Board offering low-interest mortgage loans up to $250,000 for veterans, but it’s often overshadowed by the federal VA loan program and thus underused ￼. Some states also provide property tax exemptions or reductions for veterans (usually those with service-connected disabilities). These too can be underutilized: for instance, Indiana has multiple property tax deduction categories for veterans depending on disability rating, age, and era of service ￼. Because the rules are a bit complex and not automatically applied, a number of eligible homeowners fail to apply for their deductions – effectively leaving money on the table. The pattern nationwide is that unless these state-specific housing benefits are aggressively promoted by state veterans agencies, many veterans remain unaware of them and miss out on the savings.

Underutilized Financial and Other Benefits

VA Aid & Attendance (Pension Supplement): One of the most underutilized veteran benefits is the VA’s Aid and Attendance (A&A) benefit – an enhanced monthly pension available to wartime veterans (or their surviving spouses) who are low-income and need help with daily living (e.g. dressing, bathing) due to age, disability, or illness. This benefit can subsidize in-home care or assisted living costs, potentially changing the lives of elderly veterans and caregivers ￼ ￼. Yet uptake is strikingly low. As of 2017, only 9.7% of veterans who were already on the basic VA pension had been awarded Aid & Attendance ￼ – meaning over 90% of pension-receiving veterans did not receive the additional A&A support, even though many of them likely would qualify due to poor health or need for care. The VA and eldercare advocates commonly describe A&A as “underused but potentially life-changing.” The biggest reason is lack of awareness – families often don’t know this benefit exists at all until a veteran is in dire need. Additionally, the application process is grueling and the requirements are stringent ￼. Qualifying involves detailed medical evidence, income/asset scrutiny, and paperwork that can be overwhelming for an older veteran or widow(er). It’s often recommended to seek help from a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) to successfully apply ￼. Because of these hurdles, many eligible veterans either never apply or give up during the process, leaving A&A grossly underutilized relative to its target population.

Veterans Pension (Wartime Pension): Relatedly, the base VA Pension for wartime-era veterans with low incomes is itself underutilized. This is a needs-based monthly benefit (distinct from disability compensation) for which many elderly veterans from WWII, Korea, Vietnam, etc., could qualify if they have limited means. However, the pension is not widely known outside veteran circles. The VA estimated that a significant number of potentially eligible veterans and surviving spouses are not on the pension rolls – often because they do not realize they’re eligible. Some reasons include confusion between pension vs. disability compensation (some think if they weren’t injured in service, the VA can’t help them, which is false in the case of the pension for wartime vets). Also, pride or stigma about “welfare” leads some to avoid applying. While exact uptake rates are hard to pin down, the low figure for Aid & Attendance (which piggybacks on the pension) hints at the broader pension’s underuse. In short, many indigent wartime veterans are not receiving benefits that Congress has authorized for them, primarily due to lack of outreach and complicated means-testing rules.

Life Insurance Programs: The VA offers several life insurance programs for veterans, but participation is limited. When servicemembers separate, they can convert their low-cost Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) into Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) to continue coverage. However, a minority take this option, often because they are unaware of it or find premiums less competitive as they age. The VA has acknowledged that its previous life insurance for disabled veterans (Service-Disabled Veterans Life Insurance, S-DVI) was under-enrolled – only a small fraction of eligible disabled vets carried those policies. (As of 2023, VA introduced a new program called VALife with no health requirements, aiming to improve participation). The reasons for underutilization of VA insurance include lack of awareness of conversion deadlines, belief that private insurance might be cheaper, or simply that younger veterans let coverage lapse after service. While life insurance is a personal choice, the low enrollment suggests many vets don’t revisit their insurance benefits after leaving active duty, potentially missing out on guaranteed coverage especially if their health declines.

Other Niche and State Benefits: There are many other benefits – often small or niche – that go underused. For instance, since 2015 the VA and IRS have partnered to offer free tax preparation options for veterans ￼, yet every tax season many veterans still pay for commercial tax prep or miss out on credits, indicating the free filing benefit isn’t universally recognized. Numerous states give veterans discounts on fees (like free or discounted hunting/fishing licenses in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, and others) ￼ ￼. These recreational perks see limited uptake largely because veterans either aren’t aware of the program or forget to ask for it when renewing licenses. States also maintain veterans’ cemeteries with burial benefits – for example, Kansas has four state veterans cemeteries with free burial for vets ￼, but some veterans don’t realize they must sign up or inform family of this benefit, resulting in lower utilization of state plots in favor of private cemeteries. Additionally, several states operate emergency financial assistance funds for veterans facing hardship (as in Arizona and Louisiana ￼ ￼). These funds can provide one-time grants for rent, utilities, etc., but are chronically underused because struggling veterans often don’t know such state relief exists or feel reluctance to ask for help. In all these cases, the story is the same: the benefit exists on paper and could help veterans save money or receive support, but a knowledge gap or procedural barrier prevents full participation.

Factors Contributing to Underutilization

Multiple cross-cutting factors explain why so many veteran benefits are underutilized:
	•	Lack of Awareness or Information: This is the most cited reason. Simply put, you can’t use a benefit you don’t know about. The VA’s own research and veteran service organizations note that many veterans and families are not aware of the breadth of programs available ￼ ￼. For example, a veteran may know about healthcare or the GI Bill, but not about lesser-known benefits like Aid & Attendance, free tax filing, or state-specific perks. Even widely available benefits suffer from information gaps – as noted, a major reason only 24% of veterans use VA home loans is that many are “unaware of the benefits they have or the extent of those benefits” ￼. Awareness tends to be especially poor for benefits that require proactivity (such as applying for a discount or an extra program). The VA has recognized this issue; in 2020 it overhauled its website to be more user-friendly, acknowledging that only ~39% of veterans were engaging VA services at the time ￼. VSOs, state VA departments, and even new legislation (e.g. a 2023 “VA Home Loan Awareness Act”) are all attempts to bridge the knowledge gap. Still, lack of awareness remains enemy number one behind underutilization.
	•	Complex Eligibility and Application Processes: Many benefits have complicated rules or burdensome paperwork that deter potential users. Veterans might be unsure if they qualify, or get frustrated by the red tape involved in accessing a benefit. For instance, Aid & Attendance has strict income, asset, and medical need criteria, plus a lengthy application – described as “gruelling” by those familiar with it ￼. The complexity can discourage veterans from even trying, or lead to high denial rates that further dissuade others. Similarly, state programs like property tax exemptions often require annual applications, proof of disability or wartime service, etc., which some vets find confusing ￼. The VA home loan process, while straightforward to those who use it, involves extra steps like obtaining a Certificate of Eligibility and undergoing VA-specific appraisals; these additional procedures can be seen as hurdles ￼. Every extra layer of effort – be it paperwork, medical exams, or dealing with multiple agencies – increases the chance that a veteran gives up or never starts the process. In short, a benefit with a high “hassle factor” will naturally have fewer takers. Streamlining applications and clarifying eligibility (through better guides or assistance from VSOs) can help, but until then, complex procedures will continue to suppress participation.
	•	Stigma, Pride, and Cultural Barriers: Some benefits – especially those related to health and financial need – are underutilized because of personal or cultural reluctance. Military culture often prizes self-reliance, so veterans may feel that seeking help (for mental health, or for financial assistance) is a sign of weakness or an imposition. This is a known barrier in mental health care: despite high rates of PTSD, depression, or substance use issues in the veteran community, a large percentage avoid treatment in part due to stigma ￼. Likewise, older veterans might shy away from pensions or Aid & Attendance, viewing them as “charity” or not wanting to admit they need help with daily living. Pride and misconceptions (“other veterans have it worse, I don’t want to take resources”) can cause veterans to leave benefits untapped. There is also fear of negative repercussions – e.g. a veteran worrying that using mental health services could harm their career (for active reservists) or gun rights, or that admitting a need might alter how others see them. These attitudes are slowly changing through education and campaigns (the VA’s messaging now emphasizes that asking for help is a sign of strength, and that benefits are an earned entitlement, not a handout). Nonetheless, stigma and personal reservations remain significant factors in underuse of especially healthcare and financial-relief benefits.
	•	Administrative or External Barriers: In some cases, veterans are willing and aware but still face barriers that result in underutilization. Funding caps, limited capacity, or external gatekeepers can play a role. For example, a state relief fund might be available but have an onerous review committee or run out of money if not well funded. In the housing arena, as mentioned, some veterans attempt to use their VA loan benefit but encounter reluctance from sellers or realtors, making it harder to utilize – an external barrier unique to market conditions ￼. Another example is timing and deadlines: some benefits are only available within certain time windows (e.g. converting SGLI to VGLI insurance within 1 year of discharge). A veteran who isn’t fully prepared during transition might miss the window and thus go without coverage. Additionally, inconsistent outreach by local VA offices or variations in state program administration mean some vets get more help navigating benefits than others. A telling data point comes from Kentucky’s veterans department: they offer free benefits counseling to help veterans file claims and access programs, yet currently this service “only assists 13% of the state’s veterans because many do not seek benefits” at all ￼. In other words, a large majority didn’t even come through the door to get started. This underscores how a mix of internal and external factors – whether it’s lack of outreach or veterans’ own hesitation – creates a cycle of underutilization.
	•	Narrow Eligibility or Awareness Gaps in Specific Populations: Some programs see low use simply because they target a very specific group and are not broadly advertised. For instance, a scholarship for children of fallen post-9/11 service members (such as Iowa’s War Orphan Tuition Assistance ￼) will naturally have a small eligible population and could be underused if outreach doesn’t reach all those families. Similarly, programs for minority or underserved veteran sub-groups (women veterans, LGBTQ+ veterans, etc.) might be underutilized if they aren’t effectively marketed to those communities. While not a primary factor for mainstream benefits, these gaps highlight that even well-intentioned programs can languish if the target audience isn’t effectively engaged.

In summary, underutilization of veteran benefits is usually not due to lack of need – rather it’s a byproduct of veterans not knowing about the benefit, feeling discouraged from using it, or facing practical hurdles in accessing it. Improving awareness and simplifying access are key to closing the gap. The following table summarizes some of the most underused benefits, their category, and the top reasons they go untapped:

Summary Table of Underutilized Benefits

Benefit / Program	Category	Top Reasons for Underuse
VA Health Care Enrollment & Services	Healthcare	Many veterans not enrolled or using VA care (only ~52% use any VA benefit ￼). Reasons: Lack of awareness of eligibility; some prefer private insurance; perceived bureaucracy or past negative experiences.
Mental Health Treatment (VA)	Healthcare	Low utilization relative to need (e.g. ~60% of vets who need care don’t seek it ￼). Reasons: Stigma and fear of being seen as “weak”; lack of awareness of confidential Vet Center services; skepticism about effectiveness.
Caregiver Support Program (VA)	Healthcare	Offers training, support, and stipends to caregivers of disabled vets, but many do not use it. Reasons: Until recently was limited by era (exclusion of pre-9/11); low awareness among veteran families; complicated application for stipends.
Veteran Readiness & Employment (VR&E)	Education/Employment	~125k using VR&E vs 900k using GI Bill ￼. Reasons: Not widely known compared to GI Bill; perceived as “disability only” program; lower stipend than GI Bill; requires working with counselors (some find it cumbersome).
GI Bill – Apprenticeship/OJT Route	Education/Employment	Very few GI Bill users choose apprenticeship training. Reasons: Benefit pays far less for apprenticeships (leaving tens of thousands unused ￼); veterans unaware GI Bill can cover trades/OJT; cultural bias favoring college.
VA Home Loan Guaranty	Housing	Only ~24% of eligible veteran homeowners use VA loans ￼. Reasons: Lack of awareness of VA loan benefits ￼; myths about difficult process or slow closing ￼; some sellers/realtors resistant to VA offers ￼.
Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grants	Housing	Few severely disabled vets use housing adaptation grants relative to those eligible. Reasons: Low awareness (both vets and providers) ￼; application is technical; some vets without their own home assume ineligible (not always true).
State Education Waivers & Scholarships	Education	Many states (e.g. FL, ME) offer tuition waivers for vets or their children ￼ ￼, but uptake is modest. Reasons: Programs are state-specific and not well-publicized; eligibility often narrowly defined; vets may prioritize federal GI Bill instead.
State Tax and Fee Discounts	Financial/Other	Benefits like property tax deductions (e.g. IN) or free licenses (hunting/fishing in many states) see limited use ￼ ￼. Reasons: Must proactively apply or claim each year; criteria can be confusing; veterans simply unaware these small perks exist.
Aid & Attendance (VA Pension Add-on)	Financial (Long-term Care)	Highly underused enhanced pension – <10% of eligible pensioners received it in one study ￼. Reasons: Extremely low awareness among elderly vets/caregivers; complex, stringent application process ￼; need-based nature (must admit needing daily assistance) may deter some.
Veterans Pension (Wartime)	Financial	Needs-based pension for wartime vets with low income – many eligible are not on the rolls. Reasons: Often confused with disability benefits; lack of outreach to older veterans; some feel stigma accepting income support; paperwork (income verification) is burdensome.
Veterans’ Life Insurance (VGLI/VALife)	Financial	Modest uptake of VA life insurance after service. Reasons: Many separating servicemembers don’t convert SGLI to VGLI (unaware of deadline or cost); healthier vets find private insurance; prior program (S-DVI) had low awareness. Efforts underway to improve marketing of new VALife.
State Veterans’ Assistance Funds	Financial	Emergency relief funds (e.g. AZ’s Military Family Relief Fund) often disburse less than they could. Reasons: Veterans in crisis may not know about state-run help ￼; application processes may be slow for urgent needs; some pride/stigma in asking for financial aid.
Veteran Hiring Preferences & Services	Employment	Federal and state hiring preferences and job counseling services (DVOP, etc.) are underutilized. Reasons: Not all vets transition into government jobs or know how to claim preference; many job-seeking vets unaware of dedicated employment counselors; employers may not know about incentives (e.g. hiring tax credits ￼).

Sources: Official VA reports, Military Times & VA News articles, veteran service organizations, and academic research as cited throughout this report. Key data points include VA usage statistics ￼ ￼, participation rates in specific programs ￼ ￼ ￼, and expert testimony on reasons for low uptake ￼ ￼ ￼. These illustrate a clear trend: many veteran benefits – federal and state – are underutilized due to veterans either not knowing about them, not understanding them, or facing obstacles in accessing them. By addressing these factors, stakeholders hope to ensure more veterans get the support they have earned.
